# SomeTrainingSentence
- about {@Location}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, wouldn't your {@PersonType}s have an adequate remedy under {@Location}n {@Skill} in
- {@Location}, in the {@Location}n {@Location} system? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: We might or we might not
- But that is not determinative
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: that they do not
- Let's assume that on the facts of this {@Location} they could not prevail under {@Location}n {@Skill} in
- the {@Location}n {@Location} system
- Then what {@Location} {@Location} {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@PersonType} {@Person}: -- that should override that? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: There is a strong {@Location} {@Location} interest
- It's on {@Quantity} levels
- The {@Quantity} strong {@Location} {@Location} -- {@Location} {@Location} interest deals with the conduct
- at issue here, namely the conduct in {@Location} by
- HomeSide
- This was the {@Quantity} largest mortg{@Quantity} service provider in the {@Location} {@Location}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: If we had only HomeSide's conduct, nothing else, there wouldn't be any violation
- of (b); is that right? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: We do not agree with that, Your {@Skill}
- We believe that they made a {@Skill} by
- creating the false numbers, or otherwise it's within the
- scope of the statute
- What they did is create a {@PersonType} {@Person}: But nothing has happened
- Suppose it had been caught by the {@Location}n {@Location}, and
- they didn't act on it? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Your -- Your {@Skill}, that goes to a different element of the cause of action
- That doesn't go to the scope of the statute
- That goes to how the {@PersonType} cause of action is enforced
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: {@DateTime}, I concede your argument that a big comp{@Quantity}nt of this fraud was what
- went on in {@Location}, but it needed to be disclosed to the
- public
- It needed to be put out there
- And that wasn't d{@Quantity} in {@Location} by the {@Location} {@PersonType}s
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: It was d{@Quantity} in {@Location} and we can prove that
- And -- the point is we are not -- all we are proving through doing that is the effects of the
- fraud in {@Location}
- To use Professor {@Person}'s {@Event}ple, where you have {@Location} {@Product} in {@Quantity} jurisdiction, that
- {@Location} {@Product} is sent to another jurisdiction, and in the
- {@Quantity} jurisdiction there is a {@Skill} that says "thou shalt
- not make {@Location} {@Product};" through the exercise of
- legislative jurisdiction that statute in the {@Quantity}
- jurisdiction is appropriate, and both jurisdictions have
- an interest in that
- {@DateTime}, if we are in the {@Location} {@Product} jurisdiction and we are bringing a {@Location} about {@Location}
- {@Product}, if the statute in addition says, "you have to
- show some harm from the {@Location} {@Product}," indeed you might
- as a matter of proof have to show effects from that
- other forum
- But that's different than regulating conduct in the {@Quantity} forum or anything else in the
- {@Quantity} forum
- That is simply looking at the statute or the {@Skill} prescription against making {@Location} {@Product}
- And we say section (b) is like the {@Location} {@Product} statute
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: {@PersonType} BREYER: {@DateTime}, that's -- I would like you to follow that up specifically
- That is, in my mind the difficult issue in this {@Location} is not the
- jurisdictional issue under principles of international
- {@Skill}
- It's the question of the scope of the statute
- And there the things against you are {@Quantity}
- {@Quantity} is Professor {@Person}'s argument, which I would like to k{@DateTime}
- your answer to
- The {@Quantity} is in {@Organization}'s {@Quantity} opinions
- The {@Quantity} opinion -- the {@Quantity} {@Quantity}, rather, Bersch, he says if you had a {@PersonType} exchange and
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} as -- and there was no {@PersonType}
- {@PersonType}, the {@Skill} issued over a {@PersonType} exchange,
- even if that fraud takes place totally in the {@Location}
- {@Location}, the statute wouldn't cover it
- That's {@Organization}, which started this
- And the {@Quantity} thing is what he says in {@Organization}
- He says: We cannot see any sound reason for not taking your position, at least for the {@PersonType}
- who are {@PersonType}s
- Okay? {@DateTime}, {@Location}, Britain and {@Location} have filed {@Product} in this {@Location} giving what they consider very
- sound reasons, which are reasons that {@Organization}
- never considered
- And those {@Quantity} reasons, as we k{@DateTime}, is they point to a number of conflicts, that if you win,
- how that will interfere with their efforts to regulate
- their own securities markets, right? That's all {@Quantity} question: Professor {@Person}, {@Organization} in Bersch, and {@Organization} in {@Organization}
- But that's what I'd like to hear your answer to
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I will try to keep the subparts in mind
- Why don't we start from the end and try to work backwards
- Perhaps {@Quantity} of the most important parts of the record is the Solicitor General's view that as a
- general matter -- and I will get to the specifics; I'm
- not ducking that
- But as a general matter the enforcement of the {@Skill}s, unlike the antitrust
- {@Skill}s, has not historically and {@DateTime} they do not believe
- runs -- raises a substantial risk of interstate
- conflict
- {@DateTime}, as to the specific {@Product} that Your {@Skill} referenced, if we look at those {@Product} and we look
- at those compared to what happened in {@Location} {@Event},
- those {@Product} -- and let's focus on {@Location}'s for the
- moment because that's the country we are talking about
- {@Location}'s brief essentially says they have a
- regulatory system that {@DateTime} -- that we {@DateTime} or {@DateTime} not
- have been able to litigate this cause of action in
- {@Location}, but let's assume that we could
- They are not saying -- they did not say in that brief that there was some fundamental conflict,
- like the plurality found in {@Location} {@Event}; nor did they
- say that there was the kind of conflict that comes up in
- the application of (h) of the Restatement, which
- Justice {@Person} looked to in his opinion in {@Location}
- {@Event}
- So there is not the kind of conflict that leads necessarily -- necessarily -- to not reasonably applying
- the statute
- The reason there's not is that because, {@Quantity}, there is not a rule in {@Location} that {@Quantity} has to abide
- by and a rule in the {@Location} {@Location} that {@Quantity} has to abide
- by that are contradictory
- At most, what you have is you have a clear rule in the {@Location} {@Location} that says
- thou shalt not commit fraud in {@Location} through either
- the {@Location} through either -- for or in interstate
- {@Skill}, the mails or through an exchange
- And on the other side of the equation what you have is {@DateTime}be they
- could have brought {@Product} over here and we have a robust
- regulatory system and a robust {@Skill} system; more
- power to them
- But that doesn't mean -- saying that, that doesn't mean that the {@Quantity} State where the {@Location} {@Product}
- was made suddenly has no interest in that
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, but -- but {@Location} says: Look, it's up to us to decide whether there has been a mis{@Skill}, point {@Quantity}; and whether it's
- been relied upon by the -- by the {@PersonType}, point {@Quantity}
- And we should be able to decide that and we don't want
- it decided by a {@PersonType} {@Location}
- You are talking about a mis{@Skill}, if there was {@Quantity} in this {@Location}, made in {@Location} to
- {@Location}n {@PersonType}; it ought to be up to us to decide
- that issue; and here you are dragging the {@PersonType}
- {@Location} into it
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, let me deal with the dragging in part in a minute, because that's
- subliminally very important to the {@Location}
- But let me address the direct question
- He
- {@Location}ns {@DateTime} believe that, but the question is was
- there a mis{@Skill} both in the {@Location} {@Location} and
- possibly in {@Location}? If there was in {@Location}, that's for the {@Location}ns
- That's dealing with the effects of eating the {@Location} {@Product}
- But we say a {@PersonType} {@Person}: Not to these {@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@PersonType} {@Person}: You -- you have to join the mis{@Skill} to the {@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@PersonType} {@Person}: The only mis{@Skill} to these {@PersonType} was made in {@Location} by an
- {@Location}n company
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: There are {@Quantity} ways to connect the fraud to the {@PersonType}
- The {@Quantity} is the "in connection with" requirement that deals with conduct,
- which we meet, and this {@Location} has construed very broadly
- in {@Location}, in Zandford and any other number of {@Location}s
- That's number {@Quantity}
- Number {@Quantity}, assuming that the scope of the statute is broad enough to cover the conduct in {@Location},
- we then get to the {@Quantity} question, which is the
- reasonableness of the application of the statute, and
- without a conflict, we would then look at -- to the
- interest of the {@Location} {@Location} and compare them to the
- {@Location}ns
- And the {@Location}ns can say, we can -- you k{@DateTime}, we can go after eating that {@Location} {@Product}
- And we say, fine, if you want to, that's great
- But that doesn't mean we can't go after the act of {@Location}ing the
- {@Product} in {@Location}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: But that -- that isn't the issue
- The -- the -- the issue for the {@Location}ns is: We want to determine whether there has been a
- mis{@Skill} or not
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@PersonType} {@Person}: We don't want the determination of whether there has been a
- mis{@Skill} on the {@Location}n exchange and whether
- {@Location}n {@PersonType} relied upon that mis{@Skill}
- to be determined by an {@PersonType} {@Location}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: And we say more power to you, you can decide that question
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Not if it's decided here, unless you want to say, the {@Location}n {@Location} to say, the
- {@Location} {@Location} taking this {@Location} is so outr{@Quantity}ous that we
- will not respect its judgment
- And that's a factor, too
- It's -- what conflict of {@Skill}s is all about is you have {@Quantity} jurisdictions, both with an interest in
- applying their own {@Skill}, but sometimes {@Quantity} defers to the
- other
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That's correct, Your {@Skill}
- And the question is should there be {@Skill} in this {@Location}
- And we say if you apply the standards of -- of {@Location}
- {@Event} or the standards of the Restatement, you don't end
- up in {@Skill}
- You end up in {@Skill} of the Section (b) cause of action in {@Location}
- And you do that for a couple of different reasons
- {@Quantity}, you look at the magnitude of the conduct in {@Location}, the size of this
- This is a $
- billion writedown in a {@Product}
- You have a {@Product} of $ billion worth of mortg{@Quantity}s sitting
- down in {@Location}, {@Location}
- Those are all mortg{@Quantity}s on {@PersonType} {@Product}s,  million {@PersonType} {@Product}s
- So, this is not just {@Location}, {@Location}, {@Location}
- That's what's in the {@Product} and that's what's being
- misrepresented
- And when they doctor the numbers and send them to {@Location}, it's a mis{@Skill} of
- that
- In addition, you have the overarching consideration of is it appropriate to sue {@Organization}
- {@Location} {@Location} in the {@Location} {@Location} at -- at a -- at a
- more abstract level? And the answer to that, we submit, is yes
- They have invested -- if you {@Product}e to look, it's on the SA- and SA- of the supplemental appendix,
- they have invest -- they have $ billion worth of
- assets here
- They own a {@Location} in Michigan, they have a huge trading operation on Park Avenue that trades
- billions of {@Quantity} in {@Skill} every day
- This is not the situation -- this is not the stereotype of a
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Those {@Skill} are not at issue here, right? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: I presume -- I'm sorry, go a{@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: They are only at issue in the following sense, which is that the position on the
- mortg{@Quantity} servicing rights was hedged in {@Location}
- When the hedge came und{@Quantity}, there were losses in {@Location} on
- the other side of the hedge
- That goes to the point of were there any affects in the {@Location} {@Location}, because
- there seems to be some confusion on that
- There were some effects here from the hedge
- There were some effects on -- in the {@Skill} market, but we are not -- we
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: {@Organization}
- {@Person}: -- disputing that most of the effects were over there
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Mr
- {@Person}, {@Person}, the
- {@Quantity}-named {@PersonType}, was a derivative {@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: No, Your {@Skill}
- He was the {@PersonType} of an {@Skill}
- The {@Skill} come in because they are the activity in {@Location} that is the other side of
- the transaction
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: But do you have -- you have {@Quantity} {@Event}es of {@PersonType}, {@Quantity} the {@Location}ns, who
- bought their shares in {@Location}; then you have
- {@Person}, who has an {@Skill}, and who is dismissed because
- he wasn't able to show dam{@Quantity}s
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That's true
- There -- there are no {@PersonType}s left
- This is strictly {@Location}ns
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: So what U
- {@PersonType} was harmed? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The -- the question is, were there effects on the U
- market? There were U
- {@PersonType}s who were, in all likelihood, harmed but n{@Quantity}
- have stepped {@PersonType} with respect to {@Skill} {@PersonType}s
- But if the question in the abstract is were there {@Skill}
- effects from this transaction in the {@Location} {@Location}, the
- answer is -- is yes, there were {@Event} from -- on -- on
- the derivative side, which is the other side -- which
- was the other side, in effect, the short side of what
- the long position was, which was $ billion worth of
- mortg{@Quantity}s in {@Location} that what is -- what the {@Product}
- consisted of
- {@PersonType} BREYER: What do you -- do you want to finish? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: No, Your {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Then -- I mean, I can see
- I will give you all that
- That isn't what is bothering me
- I think you are right so far as what you have argued
- But the part that I think is most difficult is why I -- I shorthand referred to Professor {@Person}'
- article
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Because what {@Location} is actually saying is what we don't like about -- about the
- {@PersonType} system, you k{@DateTime}, their -- their common
- criticisms of {@Event} actions
- We say, {@Quantity} of all, the {@PersonType} rule means even if our companies here are
- right, that they are going to have to pay their {@Skill}
- fees
- We don't like punitive dam{@Quantity}s
- We don't like that we have the opt-out
- And these are all our {@PersonType}, and we don't want to subject our companies on
- our exchange to that stuff
- {@DateTime}, fine, they have a reason on their side
- Then Professor {@Person} says: Read the statute, because they argue -- it was never intended to cover that kind
- of stuff
- {@DateTime}, that's what I would like you to address
- specifically
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, it was -- there are {@Quantity} issues
- The statute was intended to cover that kind of stuff if the antecedent of "stuff" is fraud in {@Location}
- {@DateTime}, that's a separate question from how we deal with
- the {@PersonType} right of action in these circumstances
- {@DateTime}, let's back up
- The general criticism of these {@Location}s is that they are gotcha {@Location}s
- You put in a little {@Quantity} and all of a sudden the {@PersonType} bar
- comes and attacks you
- I mean, that's the stereotype
- Well, the stereotype is wrong and it's important to
- understand why the stereotype is wrong
- Because if all you have is a very modest {@Skill} in the {@Skill} market,
- {@Quantity} like my {@PersonType}s from NAB, those {@Location}s get
- bounced at the beginning on personal jurisdiction as
- they did in the {@Location} of {@Location} in SCORS and the
- {@Organization} {@Location}
- We are not aware of any {@Location} where if all you've got is that little toehold that you stay in
- You get bounced by -- on personal jurisdiction
- And to pick up on the discussion that I was having with Justice {@Person}, we thought that in
- addition to that, if the {@Location} wanted to send signals
- with respect to these kinds of {@Location}s, if you put, as you
- can, {@Person} at the beginning of the train, even more
- of these {@Location}s if they are fallacious are going to be
- screened out of the system
- So, the point is that we can all tell our {@Location}n {@PersonType}s that there are very rigid safeguards
- in place so that this horror story in reality doesn't
- happen and it has not been proven to happen
- It is an attractive myth, but it hasn't happened
- Those {@Location}s go out and they go out early
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: I'm not sure that it happens in advance of considerable {@Skill}
- I -- I --I would agree that the {@PersonType} can confine {@Skill} to
- forum non conveniens or for personal jurisdiction, but
- in -- in these {@Location}s {@Quantity} of the things we are really
- talking about is the burden of {@Skill}
- That's the cost of {@Skill}
- You k{@DateTime} that
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I do k{@DateTime} that and let me answer briefly, because I want to reserve my time for {@Skill}
- I disagree with your fundamental observation, Justice
- {@Person}
- These {@Location}s are paid attention to by the {@Location} {@PersonType}s and they go out early
- They go out early on personal jurisdiction; there is not a lot of
- {@Skill} on that
- They go out early -- if {@Person} gets applied faithfully, it would go out early on that
- if there is a close question
- And then you go to the (b)()
- And pursuant to the Private Securities
- Litigation Reform Act, {@Quantity} of the purposes of that is no
- {@Skill}, no {@Skill} until after the motion to
- dismiss is decided
- So it is not true that there is a lot of {@Skill}, there is a lot of transaction costs, before
- we k{@DateTime} the answer to {@Quantity} of the threshold questions,
- which is: Should this {@Location} be in our system or not? That can be handled and it is being handled on a {@DateTime}
- basis, notwithstanding, you k{@DateTime}, some stereotypes
- {@DateTime}, my final point with respect to Professor {@Person}' articles and some of the other articles
- is they in effect -- if they advocate a rule, which many
- of them do, which it should be limited to exchanges,
- that goes back to my threshold point of the scope of the
- statute
- And it takes an eraser to the statute and it says: It's only exchanges; it's not in connection with {@PersonType} or interstate {@Skill} or through the mails;
- it's limited, contrary to the express words of the
- statute, in a way that the statutory {@Skill} we
- don't believe can stand it
- {@DateTime}, there are other legitimate ways of cabining the {@PersonType} cause of action
- But that -- if you are faithful to the statute, we submit that is not
- {@Quantity} of them
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Thank you,
- Mr
- {@Person}
- Mr
- {@Person}
- ORAL ARGUMENT OF {@Person}
- {@Person}, ON BEHALF OF THE {@PersonType}S {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Thank you, Mr
- {@PersonType}, and {@DateTime} it please the {@Location}: The judgment of the {@Location} of appeals should be affirmed for {@Quantity} reasons
- {@Quantity}, {@PersonType}s have identified nothing in the text of section (b) that overcomes the
- presumption against extraterritoriality or the Charming
- {@Person} Rule
- The statutes should thus be construed not to apply to transactions and shares of {@PersonType} {@PersonType}
- on {@PersonType} exchanges
- {@Quantity}, unlike the rights of action that this {@Location} has addressed in other extraterritoriality
- {@Location}s, the section (b) right is purely implied
- {@Organization} didn't intend for this right of action to exist
- even domestically, let al{@Quantity} extraterritorially
- Given the threat that the section (b} implied right presents to the sovereign authority of
- other nations, as reflected in the amicus {@Product} of
- {@Location}, the {@Location} Kingdom, {@Location}, and the
- diplomatic note from the {@Organization}, the {@Location}
- should construe the implied right not to extend to
- claims of {@PersonType} and sellers of securities of
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} on {@PersonType} markets
- The {@Quantity} clear statement rules are, obviously, the presumption against extraterritoriality
- and the Charming {@Person} Rule require that the {@Organization}
- Both require an affirmative intention of the {@Organization}
- clearly expressed before the statute can be applied to
- apply to {@PersonType} transactions or to, you k{@DateTime}, matters
- that it infringes on the sovereign authority on other
- nations
- My {@PersonType}s don't identify anything in the statute that comets even close to a clear statement
- They principally rely on the definition of "interstate
- {@Skill}," but as this {@Location} said in {@Location}, that kind
- of {@Product} simply doesn't suffice to overcome the
- presumption against extraterritoriality
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, what is your {@Skill} for whether -- whether it's being applied internationally or
- not? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, our {@Skill} is that, at a minimum, section b should be held not to apply to
- transactions involving shares of {@PersonType} issues on
- {@PersonType} exchanges, because that presents the grea{@Skill}
- danger of conflict of {@PersonType} {@Skill}, particularly in the
- context of the modern section b implied right, which
- has the fraud on the market presumption and holds
- {@PersonType} liable, as here for {@Event}ple, for {@Quantity} and a half
- years of trading, all on an {@Location}n exchange
- That is massive transfer of wealth that the {@PersonType}s here
- basically, it's a direct form of {@Skill} that
- {@Location} has not seen fit to impose upon itself
- {@PersonType} STEVENS: May I ask you on that point: Supposing the {@Event} of {@PersonType} included a group of {@PersonType}s who were share{@PersonType}s of the
- {@Location}n {@Location} and who -- but who purchased their stock
- over the {@Location}n exchange
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: We would -- well, we would submit that that rule should be the same
- That they should -- they should not also, they should not be
- allowed to sue under section b
- They -- they -- you k{@DateTime}, those people chose to purchase on the {@Location}n
- exchange
- And in terms of the threat to international comity, I think it would be probably take -- I don't
- think other countries would take nicely to a -- to a
- rule of {@Skill} that would allow {@PersonType}s, essentially, to
- bring their rules, their {@Skill}, their remedies, fraud, on
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Give me reasons for it
- The strongest {@Quantity} for it, the strongest {@Event}ple against
- you it seems to me, is {@Organization}'s {@Event}ple
- {@Person}, a {@PersonType} of {@Location}, flies to {@Location} and
- meets J{@Quantity}s in the hotel
- And J{@Quantity}s says, I have a bridge I want to sell you
- Look out the {@Product}
- Say, Do you own the {@Location} {@Location}? Yes
- And that's a lie
- Here's what you do
- You invest in buying shares of my company sold on the German exchange
- Okay? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Conduct took place in the {@Location} {@Location}, a terrible fraud
- This is contrary to fraud and, says, I think, {@Organization} and others, it
- should apply at least where {@Person} is an {@PersonType}
- {@PersonType} and Professor {@Person} says no, not even then
- What do you do with that {@Location}? The fraud took place totally here
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, I disagree with that, Your {@Skill}, I think the fraud is {@Product}ried out when the
- transaction occurs in a {@PersonType} country
- But I do agree {@PersonType} BREYER: Sign the paper here in {@Location}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Sign the paper, right here, and give me the m{@Quantity}y, because I have an urgent
- appointment
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, sir
- (Laughter
- ) {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That's a much different {@Location}, obviously, than the fraud in the market {@Location} that we
- have here
- But Your {@Skill}, yes, that is a stronger circumstance
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Yes, but your position and hers is: That's no more a valid claim than this {@Quantity} or any other {@Quantity} we dream up
- That's why it's a pure {@Event}ple, and I want to k{@DateTime} how you feel about it
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, I think that -- I think the problem is, in order to have that conduct swept
- within the statute, you have to ignore the langu{@Quantity} and
- the presumption against extraterritoriality
- If you go to {@Skill} appendix , that has its text in section b, and section b refers to the
- use or {@Skill} of any manipulative device or
- contrivance, and it's in connection with the purchase or
- sale of any {@Skill} registered on a national securities
- exchange
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Or any other
- Or -- read the next word
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That's correct
- Any {@Skill} not so registered
- And this {@Location} has held -- it has
- held in {@Location}s like {@Location}, {@PersonType} Banana, Moritson,
- that the words "any" and "every," words of universal
- scope, do not -- do not mean that these -- that
- something referred to is anything, anywhere else in the
- world
- And for {@Event}ple, the {@Location} is small against the {@Location} {@Location}
- In the {@Location} where the presumption of extraterritoriality didn't really apply the {@Location} held
- that in a statute, you normally assume that things being
- referred to are thing in the {@Location} {@Location}
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: Is the {@Skill} going to tell us that its {@Skill}, which differs from the {@PersonType}
- exchange {@Skill}, is based on considerations like those
- suggested in Justice {@Person}'s {@Location} {@Location}
- hypothetical? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I think they do
- I think they look to -- I think their view is that the statute is
- vague and you have to do essentially what {@Organization}
- did and the Seventh {@Location} did for many years, is you
- have to make do and decide what the best rule is
- And with respect to the {@Skill}, that is essentially
- doing what this {@Location} has said under the presumption
- against extraterritoriality the {@Location} shouldn't do
- That's essentially {@Skill}, trying to figure out
- what {@Organization} would have d{@Quantity}, had "a particular
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: {@PersonType} KENNEDY: Would the limitations on {@Skill} give you substantial protection were we to
- adopt the {@Skill}'s {@Skill} or say the {@PersonType} exchange
- {@Skill} with the subset exceptions for the -- that takes
- account of the {@Skill}'s {@Skill}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Your {@Skill}, I think the problem with the {@Skill}'s {@Skill} and with the {@Quantity} {@Location}'s
- {@Skill}, is that it would still allow the application of U
- {@Skill} in a manner that would infringe the sovereign authority of other nations
- And I can give an {@Event}ple
- There was a {@Location} over {@DateTime} that the {@PersonType}s attached to their
- {@Quantity} supplemental brief on the {@Skill} for certiorari
- And it's a {@Location} called {@Product} shifts
- And it's an interesting {@Location} because it involved a Canadian company
- with {@Location} in Britain and most of whose shares
- traded on the {@Organization}
- And what happened there was that the {@PersonType} spent time in {@Location} -- it was a shipping company
- We spent time in, {@Location} running the show from {@Location}
- And the {@Location} of appeals for the Eleventh {@Location}, in a
- ruling that it held was consistent with the {@Quantity}
- {@Location} decision in this {@Location} held that n{@Quantity}theless, the
- application of U
- {@Skill} could be applied to transactions
- of -- of {@PersonType} {@PersonType} on the Toronto Stock
- Exchange
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: Is it a consideration that {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, {@Skill} al{@Quantity}
- Yes, Your {@Skill}
- {@Skill} al{@Quantity}
- I think the {@PersonType} brief, for {@Event}ple, points that out
- I think a number of the brief -- there have been blocking statutes that have
- been enacted by various countries because of the -- what
- they deem to be the offensive scope of {@Skill}
- In {@Location}, you are really only allowed to obtain evidence
- that is actually admissible in {@Event}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: I'm not sure how you interpret the langu{@Quantity} that you -- that you just read,
- when you say to use or employ in connection with the
- purchase or sale of any {@Skill} registered on the
- {@Organization} {@Skill} Exchange or any {@Skill} not so
- registered
- {@DateTime}, is it your point that in order to avoid an international extension of it, it should apply only
- to securities? What? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@PersonType} {@Person}: Securities purchased and sold in the {@Location} {@Location}? Is that it? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That -- that's correct, Your
- {@Skill}
- I think that's a fair reading of the statute
- And this {@Location} is required, under both the presumption
- against extraterritoriality under its decision and the
- Charming {@Person} Rule to interpret a statute, take the
- permissible {@Skill} of the statute that is least
- likely to result in an extraterritorial of the {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Purchased -- purchased or sold? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Purposed or sold, Your {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: What if it's not -- what if it -- what if the fraud produces neither a purchase or a
- sale but induces somebody to hold on to stock that
- otherwise the person would dispose of? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, I -- I don't k{@DateTime} that that would state a claim, a {@PersonType} claim under {@Organization}
- {@Product}
- And any -- and if the share or the securities are held abroad, if it's a {@PersonType} {@Skill},
- and I think the liability in that hypothetical -- I'm
- assuming that if it's a {@PersonType} {@Skill} held by a
- {@PersonType} -- that really would be something that would
- be subject to {@PersonType} {@Skill}, whether or not {@Location}
- wants to represent -- recognize {@PersonType} claims of the
- sort that this {@Location} rejected in {@Organization} {@Product}
- That's a question for {@Location} to decide
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Under these same
- facts if you had -- altering according to the
- hypothetical, you had U
- {@PersonType} who purchased
- {@Organization} {@Location} {@Location} {@Skill}s on the {@Location} exchange,
- you don't doubt that they can sue, do you? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: No, and in fact, we told the {@Location} {@Location}, we did not move to defense on
- extraterritoriality grounds the claims of Mr
- {@Person},
- who inexplicably is still here
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Right
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: We argued that Mr
- {@Person}'s claims should be defeated on the grounds that he had no
- dam{@Quantity}s, which was an absolutely ironclad {@Skill}
- best based on a -- on a provision of the {@Organization}, and we
- also argued that all of the claims should be dismissed
- for failure to plead fraud with the requisite
- particularity of the {@Organization}
- But we certainly do not dispute that when a company like ours registers shares on -- registers
- shares with the {@Organization}, {@Skill}s with its {@Organization} and lists them on
- a {@Location} stock exchange, it's subjecting itself to New
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: And presumably that would impose the same {@Skill} on the {@Location} as the
- Sudanese {@Location}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: It could, Your {@Skill}, that's
- absolutely true
- But on the other hand, I mean, a lot of the other aspects of -- of this {@Skill}, which
- this {@Location} has, you k{@DateTime}, noted that is potentially
- highly vexatious, I mean, that is only
- {@Quantity} of
- the flow -- of the total equity securities of the -- the
- {@Organization} {@Location} {@Location}
- So the dangers of -- of a threat of -- of coerced settlements is much, much less
- It's a much, much easier {@Location} to deal with if -- if -- if you are only dealing with the {@Skill}s
- {@DateTime} if another company decides to list half its equity on
- the {@Location} Stock Exchange, well, it can -- it makes
- the determination for itself, how much of this kind of
- {@Skill} it wants to subject itself to
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: Suppose there were {@Skill} with substantial allegations of wire fraud
- violations as predicate for {@Location} violations, and the
- {@Location} begins to proceed, and then there is a {@Quantity} cause
- of action under the {@Skill}
- Would -- would the fact that there is going to be {@Skill} and substantial
- {@Skill} in the -- in the {@Location} {@Location} {@Location} be a
- factor in retaining the -- the securities violation in
- this {@Product}? Or would the {@Skill} be just the same in your view? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I think the -- I think you have to take each statute separately
- You have to look at
- what the langu{@Quantity} of the statute says, whether it -- it
- admits fault in an extraterritorial reading, and whether
- that -- f{@Skill}ly whether that extraterritorial reading is
- required or compelled
- If there is any other possible {@Skill}, as the {@Location} said in -- in Charming {@Person},
- the {@Location} is required to accept that {@Skill},
- accept the {@Skill} that doesn't result in
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: On the -- on the extraterritorial presumption against it, your {@PersonType}
- on the other side tells us that in all the {@Location}s where
- the presumption applied, all of the conduct was
- someplace else, and they give the {@Location} {@Location} and say
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@PersonType} {@Person}: -- and everything happened outside the country
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@PersonType} {@Person}: Here, I mean, you have to concede that a comp{@Quantity}nt of the alleged fraud occurred
- in {@Location}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: We do concede that some of the conduct that ultimately, you k{@DateTime}, led -- in a but-for
- causal relationship to what happened in the {@Location}
- occurred in the {@Location} {@Location}, but that's true in a lot
- of other {@Location}s
- For {@Event}ple, {@Location}, Mr
- {@Person} was hired in Houston
- So was the {@PersonType} in Foley Brothers v
- {@Person}
- And in {@Organization} v
- {@Organization}, basically all of the conduct, the relevant conduct was in the {@Location} {@Location},
- because what the -- what section (f) proscribed in
- {@Organization} was the shipment -- the supply in or from the
- {@Location} {@Location} of a comp{@Quantity}nt of a patented invention
- And what this {@Location} held in {@Organization} was that notwithstanding {@Organization}'s argument that, "Hey, the
- presumption against extraterritoriality doesn't really
- apply because this is just regulating the supply in and
- from the {@Location} {@Location}," this {@Location} held that the
- presumption against extraterritoriality applied because
- what would happen is, a single act of supply would
- result in a springboard for liability each time a -- a
- {@Product} was put into a computer abroad
- And that is exactly analogous to the circumstances in this {@Location}, where what we -- what
- happened was some -- some allegedly false information
- was transmitted to {@Location}; it was then republished in
- allegedly, as they would have it -- resulted in
- purchased a share of stock of the {@Organization} {@Location}
- {@Location} on the {@Location}n securities exchange
- And so that is exactly analogous to -- to {@Organization} v
- {@Organization}
- Again, another point I think that's relevant is the, section  of the Exchange Act
- {@Organization} did not make a clear statement in section
- It did make clear statements in section
- Section (a) addresses transactions on {@PersonType} exchanges
- Section  as a whole is entitled {@Skill} Exchanges, and section (a)
- makes it -- makes -- gives the {@Organization} power to promulgate
- regulations that -- that apply to {@PersonType} and dealers
- who effect transactions of securities on {@PersonType}
- exchanges, if those transactions are transactions of
- shares of shares of U
- {@PersonType}
- And that's at -- for reference, the text of section  is at p{@Quantity}  of the {@Skill} professors' brief
- And section (b) also, it says that the {@Organization} can
- of businesses -- securities that are abroad, but only to
- the extent the {@Organization} finds it necessary to prevent evasion
- of the Act domestically
- And so {@Organization} made {@Quantity} clear statements in section
- It did not make any clear statement in section
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, is that your only point? Or is your point also that you wouldn't need
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@PersonType} {@Person}: -- were read as broadly
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That's absolutely right
- The reading -- my {@PersonType}'s reading of section  would
- render section (b) -- I mean the reading of section
- (b) would render section  superfluous
- And there are other provisions of -- that are in the Exchange Act
- where {@Organization} has made clear statements to show that it
- can make clear statements
- Section A which immediately follows section , is the {@Skill} Corrupt
- Practices Act
- So {@Organization} -- if {@Organization} -- if there is a loophole, and that's what this {@Location} said in {@Organization} v
- {@Organization}; if there is some kind of loophole that presents some kind of a problem, that {@Organization} needs to fix,
- {@Organization} can do it
- {@Organization} can do it with a clear statement
- In sum, Your {@Skill}s, countries -- nations of the world do things differently
- They -- they -- they have different rules of liability
- We see in the amicus {@Product} different rules of materiality, different rules
- of disclosure
- And some rely on -- on {@Skill} more than others
- The {@PersonType} rely on l'action publique, as
- they say; and some nations approach ours in their
- generosity to {@PersonType}
- {@Location} allows opt-out {@Event} actions; so does {@Location}
- {@Location} allows opt-out {@Event} actions; it dispenses with, for {@Event}ple, the proof
- of reliance, it dispenses with {@PersonType} in some {@Location}s
- Yet it -- it does all that, but it restricts liability
- {@PersonType} BREYER: How does it hurt the other countries if what we would say on their reading of this
- is, {@Organization} has said, "Look, if some terribly bad
- conduct happens in the {@Location} {@Location}; they lie through
- their teeth; and you, whoever you are in the world, who
- buys some shares and as a result you are hurt, we will
- give you a remedy
- Come to us" -- {@DateTime}, how does that hurt {@Location}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@PersonType} BREYER: Or {@Location} or England or any of these others? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Exactly the same way this {@Location} said it hurts in {@Skill}
- In {@Skill} this {@Location} noted that -- that a reading of the rule that would allow -- a
- reading of the {@Organization} that would have allowed {@PersonType}
- {@PersonType} to come and sue for -- for {@PersonType} vitamins
- transaction in a {@PersonType} country would essentially allow
- {@PersonType} to avoid the -- the narrower rules of the
- liability and the narrower remedies that other nations
- provide
- And that is exactly true here, where, you k{@DateTime}, for {@Event}ple, {@Location} does not permit
- fraud-on-the-market {@Event} actions
- it doesn't recognize the fraud-on-the-market
- presumption
- And as I said, for {@Event}ple, {@Location} restricts these actions, it has generous liability rules and
- allows opt-out {@Event} actions, but it says -- it caps
- dam{@Quantity}s at  {@Quantity} of an issuer's market
- capitalization or $ million, whichever is greater
- And so that's the -- that is the problem
- It's not just substance but it's remedy
- Other nations want to do things in different ways; they should be
- allowed to
- What is going on here is essentially a --Brandeising -- experiment a global scale
- And that's a good thing
- It's a good thing because it enables countries to {@PersonType} for themselves what kind of rules
- they want to have for people who buy shares on their own
- exchanges
- And to apply section (b) it {@Location}s like this would cut that experiment short
- It would amount to exactly the soft of {@Skill} imperialism that this {@Location}
- rejected, rightly, in {@Skill}
- The {@Location} should reject it here as well and it should affirm the judgment of the
- {@Location} of appeals
- I thank you
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Thank you, Mr
- {@Person}
- Mr
- {@Person}
- ORAL ARGUMENT OF {@Person}
- {@Person}, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIE, SUPPORTING THE {@PersonType}S {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Mr
- {@PersonType}, and {@DateTime} it please the {@Location}: This {@Location} presents {@Quantity} distinct questions: {@Quantity} whether the fraud alleged by {@PersonType}s violated
- Section b; and {@Quantity}, whether {@PersonType}s {@DateTime} bring a
- {@PersonType} action
- In our view, the alleged fraud violated Section b, because significant conduct material to the
- fraud's success occurred in the {@Location} {@Location}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: There are -- there are a lot of moving parts in that {@Skill}
- You k{@DateTime}, significant conduct, material, you require it to have a
- direct causal relationship
- Doesn't the complication of that kind of defeat the whole purpose? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: No, Your {@Skill}, we don't think so
- In terms of the -- of the direct cause part, which it will be -- the significant limit on {@PersonType} actions,
- as this {@Location} illustrates, the {@Location} {@Location} even
- accepting the allegations in the {@PersonType}'s complaint
- will often be able to dismiss the {@Product} on the {@Skill}
- for its failure to satisfy that {@Skill}
- It's not a {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: That's only for the {@PersonType} companies? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That's right
- And in terms of the other {@Skill}, again, I don't think it's that
- complicated
- The -- the significance part of it is essentially trying to assess the amount of the conduct
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: what if significant elements of the fraud occur in {@Quantity}
- different countries? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: If -- if -- the critical question is whether there's significant conduct here
- that's material to the broad success
- And the reason for that is if Section b didn't cover that kind of
- conduct, then that would risk allowing the {@Location} {@Location}
- to become a base for orchestrating securities frauds for
- {@Skill}
- It would allow thing like {@PersonType} in the {@Location} {@Location} {@Product}ering international b{@Product}er {@Location}
- schemes in which they direct {@PersonType} in {@PersonType} countries
- to make fraudulent {@Skill}s that victimize
- {@PersonType}s
- {@PersonType} BREYER: So it's not as easy to apply this, you think? {@DateTime}, on your theory, I guess {@Person} is in {@Location} and we have our {@Location} {@Location}
- Okay, {@DateTime} wait
- What happens is he calls {@Person} on the teleph{@Quantity}, J{@Quantity}s, and he says I own the {@Location} {@Location}
- Actual, right, direct? Under your {@Skill}, correct? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@Person} is in {@Location}? {@PersonType} BREYER: {@Person} is in {@Location}
- He calls him up
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The defrauder is in {@Location}? {@PersonType} BREYER: All -- everything -- you have to assume he's going to buy the thing on the
- exchange in {@Location} but the fraud is in {@Location}
- He is lying about -- he doesn't really own the {@Location}
- {@Location}
- So he calls {@Person}
- I am interested in -- he calls {@Person}
- Causation, that's what your last p{@Quantity}s of your brief, focus on that
- He calls him and he lies to him
- Actual
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I'm sorry, Your {@Skill}, can I ask you if everybody is in {@Location}? {@PersonType} BREYER: No
- (Laughter
- ) {@PersonType} BREYER: Go back to my {@Location} {@Location} {@Event}ple
- Everything is hatched in your b{@Product}er
- {@Location}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Okay
- {@PersonType} BREYER: And they communicate the lie by calling {@Person} in Berlin on the teleph{@Quantity},
- directly
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Okay
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: {@Person} is the German
- He's in {@Location}
- (Laughter
- ) {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I'm sorry
- {@PersonType} BREYER: {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The question is, is there {@PersonType} BREYER: No, I'm focusing on the last p{@Quantity}s of your brief
- Where you turn this whole thing on the directness of the {@Skill}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That's right
- And the {@Organization} would be able to take action if there is significant
- {@PersonType} BREYER: I'm accepting that for the moment
- What's bothering me, taking off from what the {@PersonType} said, is the feasibility of your {@Skill}
- Your {@Skill}, it seems to me on {@Skill}, would say that
- when you ph{@Quantity} {@Person} and lie to him, he can sue
- But when you ph{@Quantity} your {@PersonType} company, k{@DateTime}ing that they
- will put it in the prospectus and {@Person} will read it,
- you can't sue
- And then what occurs to me is suppose you ph{@Quantity}d a {@PersonType}, or suppose you ph{@Quantity}d your {@PersonType}
- company and you knew they would tell a {@PersonType}
- I'm focusing on the practicality of your {@Skill} {@Skill}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: If the conduct is directed or {@PersonType} BREYER: Correct
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: -- then it would -- then the direct {@Skill} {@Skill} would be -- would be met
- The critical question is, is the conduct in the {@Location}
- {@PersonType} BREYER: You think that's the question here? You think the question is whether this really took place in {@Location}? I didn't think that was the question
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: In terms of a {@PersonType} {@PersonType} suing, in our view, the question is whether
- the {@Location} {@Location}' conduct has a close enough connection
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Let's skip -- skip my question because other people {@DateTime} ask
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: If the {@PersonType} in this {@Location} had clearly alleged in their complaint that nobody
- in {@Location} reviewed the numbers that were sent from
- {@Location} to any {@Quantity}, they just directly copied them,
- some low-level {@PersonType} directly copied them, would the
- direct cause {@Skill} be met? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, if the action was just ministerial over overseas, it would -- it would be met
- Again, the critical question, in our view, under the
- direct cause {@Skill} is, was there culpable conduct in the
- {@Location} {@Location} that is directly responsible for the
- {@PersonType}'s injury? {@PersonType} {@Person}: {@PersonType} KENNEDY: Well, then you give no weight to the fact that it was on the {@Location}n
- exchange? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The -- the fact that the transaction happens on the {@Location}n exchange is not
- dispositive, because if -- if somebody in the {@Location}
- {@Location} is directly -- is -- is executing the fraud -- if
- it turned on just a transaction on the {@Location}n
- exchange, then a domestic {@PersonType} could be injured by a
- fraud that is hatched entirely here that is executed
- entirely here, and he is tricked into executing a
- transaction on an overseas exchange
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Mr
- {@Person}, because your time is running out, there is a basic question here
- You are asking us to make a distinction between what the
- {@Organization} can sue for and what a {@PersonType} party can sue for
- {@Organization} did that with respect to aiders and abettors
- Is there any other instance in which we have made a distinction, yes, the {@Organization} has a claim but the
- {@PersonType} litigant doesn't? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, the -- the -- the {@PersonType} litigants are -- have numerous elements that they have
- to show that the {@Organization} doesn't have to show: Reliance, loss, loss {@Skill}
- All of those go to the causal link between the injury and -- and the fraud
- And we think that the direct injury requirement is an
- appropriate application of those more general {@Skill}
- requirements in the context of transnational fraud
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: I am f{@Skill}ly less concerned with your -- your {@Skill} for the {@PersonType} cause of action,
- the direct cause {@Skill} -- I -- I guess I could work with
- that -- than I am with your {@Skill} for -- for the
- jurisdiction of the -- of the {@Organization}, which is sort of a
- totality of the circumstances {@Skill}
- It doesn't seem to me that's an appropriate {@Skill} for a jurisdictional
- question
- You don't want to spend time {@Skill} the totality of the circumstances
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: We don't think it's a -- a jurisdictional question in the sense of the subject
- matter jurisdiction, Your {@Skill}
- It's a -- a {@Skill} about the scope of the statutory cover{@Quantity}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, okay
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: And it's true that bright line rules -- it's true that bright line rules are easier to
- administer, but the -- there is a danger in bright line
- rules for fraud prohi{@Quantity}ions because they can provide a
- road map for evasion of the statute
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Do you have any indication that our {@PersonType}s around the world are
- comfortable with your {@Skill}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, the {@Product} that have been filed by {@Location} and {@Location} Kingdom and {@Location}
- are limited to the {@PersonType} right of action
- They base their -- what they want to do is to limit the {@PersonType}
- rights
- And I think the {@Location} Kingdom brief specifically says that -- it thinks that {@Organization} action
- could be appropriate here, and that's a reason why, if
- the {@Location} adopts the -- a limit on the {@PersonType} actions,
- that it need not -- it need not be concerned about the
- possibility that -- that fraud would be launched in the
- {@Location} {@Location} or directed in the {@Location} {@Location} and it
- couldn't be addressed
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: I guess we don't have to say anything about -- about what the {@Skill} can do,
- do we? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: No, Your {@Skill}
- And we would certainly prefer that you decided the {@Location} solely on the
- {@PersonType} right of action if the alternative for a holding
- substantive prohi{@Quantity}ions didn't apply here
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Mr
- {@Person}, you urge deference to the {@Organization}'s interpretation in
- administrative adjudications? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Do you have anything other than those {@Quantity} proceedings over the last  years? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Those are the {@Quantity} administrative adjudications
- The {@Organization}'s administrative adjudicatory authority is limited to people involved in
- the securities industry, and a lot of these frauds that
- happen are -- don't involve people that are registered
- {@PersonType}/dealers and the like
- There are numerous Civil Actions that the {@Organization} has brought where it has taken the
- same approach
- The {@Organization} v
- {@Person} {@Location} that we cite in our brief is {@Quantity} of them
- I can name some others
- There is {@Organization} v
- {@Person}, which is a {@Location} that's in the {@Location}
- {@Location} in Utah, and {@Organization} v
- {@Person} in -- in the southern
- {@Location} of {@Location}
- {@Organization} v
- {@Location} in the northern {@Location} of {@Organization}inois
- Those involve international
- b{@Product}er-{@Location} schemes of the kind I was alluding to
- before, where {@PersonType} in the {@Location} {@Location} basically
- direct {@PersonType} that they have got in countries like
- {@Location} or Spain to -- to make false statements and
- eng{@Quantity} in high-pressure {@Skill} to target {@PersonType}s in
- other countries
- Sometimes they induce them to eng{@Quantity} in transactions in still other countries
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Thank you, Mr
- {@Person}
- Mr
- {@Person}, you have {@Quantity} minutes remaining
- REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF {@Person}
- {@Person} ON BEHALF OF THE {@PersonType} {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Thank you, Your {@Skill}
- Let me begin with Justice {@Person}'s question, and I promise to
- get back to {@Organization} and the {@Location} {@Location}
- As to -- we have alleged that in -- that effectively, ministerial activities did occur here
- The {@Quantity} {@Location} held, interpreting our complaint, that
- the numbers were {@Skill}ly incorporated
- That's as close to ministerial as you get
- We used, in the complaint, the were "adopted
- " We said that they were asleep at the {@Product}
- The meaning is the same, but the -- there were no
- {@Location}s
- The {@Location}s are illusory
- If there was a {@Location}, the guard was asleep at the
- {@Location}, and the {@Organization}R number went right through the
- {@Location}
- Those are the allegations, and we should be able to stick with the allegations
- {@DateTime}, turning to the statute, my {@PersonType} indicated that the langu{@Quantity} with respect to {@PersonType} and
- interstate {@Skill} and so on, based on the {@Location}
- decision, was {@Product}
- That's wrong
- In this statute, those specific statutory approaches towards
- stopping fraud are in the substance of the statute
- They are not in the jurisdictional statute
- That's important
- That's why that's different
- As to the {@Organization} {@Event}ple and Bersch {@Event}ple, what {@Organization} shows is a long chain of {@Skill}, because
- {@Organization} involved an {@PersonType}, not a {@PersonType}, which was
- very important under {@Organization}'s typology
- And in {@Organization}, you have this extended line of {@Skill}
- beginning with {@Skill}s in the {@Location} {@Location}
- about a {@PersonType}ly, tender offer
- Then there was a ph{@Quantity} call, {@DateTime}be in {@Location}, {@DateTime}be in the {@Location} {@Location}, and
- then there was a command by {@Person} to his
- {@Skill} {@Location}ers: Go into the {@Location} Stock Exchange and start to buy
- That extended line of {@Skill} would not pass muster under the direct cause {@Skill}
- The direct cause {@Skill} as this {@Location} is using it in the {@Location} area
- State {@Skill}? I mean, it's -- it's commonplace for the Federal {@Skill} to look to State {@Skill} on issues of ownership
- And, in fact, if there is this doctrine of equitable
- ownership on the part of the {@PersonType}, what right does
- the {@Skill} have to do the setoff? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, that might be true if we were relying on a common {@Skill} {@Skill}
- But in this context, {@Organization} has directed that all Federal
- {@Skill}s, unless there is an exception -- and there is
- no exception in this {@Location} -- are to be {@Skill} before
- {@Skill}, any {@Skill}, to the {@PersonType}
- So in this {@Location}, {@Organization} has effectively established a priority scheme
- whereby when a {@PersonType} owes a delinquent valid debt to
- the {@Location} {@Location} and the {@Location} {@Location} owes an
- {@Skill}ting obligation to that individual, {@Organization} has
- provided that no Federal funds shall be paid to the
- individual and instead that the debt -- the {@Skill}'s
- debt shall be {@Skill} against the debt that the --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: What if the {@PersonType} is {@Location}rupt? What happens then? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The same rule would apply
- No Federal {@Skill} would -- well -- I believe that the same
- rule would apply
- I've not {@Product}efully studied the {@Location}ruptcy provisions, and I hate to venture into a very
- complicated area to give you something definitive
- But
- my belief is that, based on the very clear text of
- section  of Title , which was amended by the Debt
- Collection {@Organization}provement Act, that no {@Skill} shall be --
- even in {@Location}ruptcy, the {@Skill} goes to the -- has
- to go to the {@PersonType} {@Quantity}, and then it goes to the estate
- -- that no {@Skill} shall be made from the {@Organization} and
- instead an administrative {@Skill} shall be undertaken to
- collect the {@Skill}'s debt
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Is there a way for the {@PersonType} -- a {@PersonType} sees that his {@PersonType} has a good {@Location}
- against the {@Skill}, and thinks he can get an {@Organization}
- fee, so he says to the {@PersonType}: I'd like to represent you and I can get paid for this
- But the {@PersonType} says: There are a lot of debts I owe the {@Skill}
- {@DateTime}, is there any way they can work it out so he can get the {@Skill}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, sure
- Theres --{@PersonType} BREYER: What? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: As we indicated in our brief, there's several things that can be d{@Quantity}
- {@Quantity}, the {@PersonType} can determine whether there is in fact a debt
- which is eligible for {@Skill}, and that can be d{@Quantity} by
- asking the {@Organization} with a valid Privacy Act waiver from
- the {@PersonType}
- If that is the {@Location}, the {@PersonType} retains the right, which {@Organization} expressly codified in section
- , the right to enter into a re{@Skill} agreement
- If that is d{@Quantity}, there will be no {@Skill}, and the re{@Skill}
- agreement is largely governed by the Federal claims
- {@Skill} standards, which are codified at  C
- to , and those -- those provisions provide in section
- , for instance, that installments shall -- should
- bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and
- the {@PersonType}'s ability to pay
- And in some instances, the {@Skill} {@Quantity}ncy is able to compromise that debt if the
- {@PersonType} is unable to repay it within a reasonable amount of
- time
- The {@Quantity}ncy should consider the {@Quantity}, health, present and potential income, as well as assets of the
- {@PersonType}, in order to determine the --{@PersonType} BREYER: In other words, the {@PersonType} and the {@Quantity}ncy and the {@PersonType} sit down, and the {@PersonType}
- says: Here, I can get some m{@Quantity}y for this {@PersonType} and that will help everybody, but I want to be paid
- So I want you, Agency, to agree that on the re{@Skill}
- schedule if I get an {@Organization} fee, then I get to keep it and
- I don't have to give it to my {@PersonType}, who will have to
- give it to the {@Skill}
- And then they can sign a piece of paper and then that's d{@Quantity} and the {@PersonType} gets
- to keep the m{@Quantity}y
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That -- that's correct
- {@PersonType} BREYER: And has that ever happened?
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I don't k{@DateTime} that that's happened in this {@Skill} context
- {@PersonType} BREYER: But it could {@DateTime}
- {@DateTime} people would k{@DateTime} about, and they could do it
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: It could well happen, and in fact --{@PersonType} KENNEDY: Well, whats -- whats the authority for the {@Skill} to enter into the agreement? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The authority --{@PersonType} KENNEDY: I mean, if the statute says there has to be an {@Skill}, that's it
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, the statute also provides, under section , for the {@Organization} and the
- {@Organization} to establish guidelines for
- {@Quantity}ncies
- They have d{@Quantity} so in Parts  to -- or  to  of Title  of the Code of Federal Regulations
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: But do the guidelines reflect Justice {@Person}'s hypothetical? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, the statute actually reflects Justice {@Person}'s hypothetical, because at
- section  -- this is at p{@Quantity} a of the {@Skill}'s
- briefs appendix -- the {@PersonType} of the {@Quantity}ncy, prior to
- {@Skill} an administrative {@Skill} must advise --
- this is on a -- the {@PersonType} of the opportunity to make a
- written agreement with the {@PersonType} of the {@Quantity}ncy to repay
- the amount of the claim
- That reflects the {@Event} in the Federal claims {@Skill} standards of agreeing to
- re{@Skill} of such claims
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: Could you tell me what would motivate the {@Skill} to agree to give to a
- {@PersonType} a piece of a recovery that it, the {@Skill},
- thinks it's entitled to? I mean, it's {@Quantity} thing to work a re{@Skill} plan
- That starts on the proposition that the individual can only {@DateTime} or month or whatever
- give a certain amount of m{@Quantity}y over
- But what --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, I think the hypothetical was premised at the beginning of the {@Skill}{@Product} rather than at
- the end
- If -- if the {@Location} were at the end and the {@Skill} were ordered to pay {@Organization} fees, the {@Skill}
- would be automatic
- We would not agree at that point to split the -- the {@Skill} with -- with the {@PersonType}
- But in the beginning of the {@Skill}{@Product}, when the {@PersonType} is
- undertaking {@Skill} of the {@PersonType}, the {@PersonType}
- is able to do precisely what {@Organization} intended, which
- was to have {@PersonType}s come to the {@Location} {@Location} and
- take -- to avail themselves of the opportunity to repay
- their debts to avoid an {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, but that's a fanciful answer, because {@Organization} requires that the
- {@Skill}'s position, to get fees, is substantially
- unjustified
- And so the {@Skill} {@PersonType} is going to sit down and say, well, you k{@DateTime}, if I take a position
- that is substantially unjustified, I will at that point
- pay the fees to you, not to the {@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, not at all
- The {@Skill}'s interest in an installment plan is not
- motivated by {@Organization}
- The {@Skill}s interest is --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Yes, but the {@PersonType}'s interest -- I thought in the hypothetical we
- were talking about, the {@PersonType}'s interest is
- He thinks the {@Skill} is going to take a substantially
- unjustified position, and he wants to make sure in that
- {@Location} that he gets paid
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: This is a separate question, which is whether there is really any deterrent or how
- large the deterrent effect would be having the specter
- of a fee {@Skill}
- And as we explained in our brief, this {@Location} in {@Location} explained that, because {@Organization} awards
- are not given to every prevailing party and are only
- given to parties where the {@Skill}'s position is not
- substantially justified, it is -- {@Quantity} cannot reliably
- determine in advance whether the {@Skill}'s position
- is going to be so unreasonable that youre going to get
- an award of fees
- And that -- that suggests that any deterrent
- effect of having the possibility of an {@Skill}ting -- an
- {@Skill} for the {@PersonType}'s debt is small
- And that --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, that's going to look awful bad to a {@Location} that comes in and he's --
- and the {@Location} is asked to award {@Organization} fees, and there is
- an agreement already in effect
- The {@Skill} says, well, if were -- you k{@DateTime}, if were liable for {@Organization}
- fees, this is how we are going to handle it
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I {@DateTime} have misspoken --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: That would be the {@Quantity} piece of -- that would be the {@Quantity} piece of
- evidence that I would want to put in saying I should get
- {@Organization} fees
- The {@Skill} thought they might even take a position that {@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Let me back up
- I {@DateTime} have misspoken
- What I intended to convey is that at the beginning of the {@Location} when an {@PersonType} is deciding
- whether to represent a {@PersonType}, the {@Location} has not been
- litigated, we don't k{@DateTime} whether the {@Skill}'s
- position is going to be found to be substantially
- unjustified or not, the {@PersonType} -- if the {@PersonType}
- checks and wants to determine whether the {@PersonType} has
- a -- a debt owed to the {@Skill} that would be subject
- to {@Skill}, the {@PersonType} can go to the {@Skill} and say:
- Let's enter into a re{@Skill} plan so that my {@PersonType} gets
- on the {@Skill}'s good g{@Event}s and no longer is subject to
- have a {@Skill} -- a {@Skill} return, for instance, {@Skill} or any
- other {@Skill} that the {@Skill} {@DateTime} owe to that
- {@PersonType} in the future, including {@Organization}
- But it's not because of the {@Organization} {@Skill} that you would enter into
- the agreement
- The {@Skill} --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: No, but say he goes in to the {@Skill} and says, look, Im about to sue
- you, and Id like to sit down and negotiate a nice
- agreement about the re{@Skill}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, I guess the {@PersonType} {@DateTime} say, I'm about to sue you, but the {@Skill} certainly
- is not motivated because of the {@Skill}{@Product}
- The {@Skill} -- whether an {@PersonType} is going to sue the
- {@Skill} or not, the question is --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Government {@PersonType}s are always sympathetic to people who come in and say:
- I'm going to sue you
- (Laughter
- ) {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, I guess that certainly gets our attention
- But the reason that the {@Skill} would enter into a re{@Skill} agreement is because that is an
- opportunity for the {@Skill} to collect a debt that is
- delinquent, valid, and outstanding
- And what {@Organization} intended to do in the Debt
- Collection {@Organization}provement Act was not to have additional
- Federal funds be paid to {@PersonType}s who have been given
- multiple warnings of the debt and are essentially, you
- k{@DateTime} --{@PersonType} {@PersonType}: The problem with your argument is this pot of m{@Quantity}y is actually not going
- to -- it's going to the {@PersonType}, according to your
- argument, because in theory the {@PersonType} is the prevailing
- party and is entitled to get the award
- But the m{@Quantity}y is not being paid to the {@PersonType}
- It's for the benefit of the {@PersonType} who has d{@Quantity} the work that {@Organization} wanted
- d{@Quantity}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, actually, either --{@PersonType} {@PersonType}: I don't k{@DateTime} what the --I don't k{@DateTime} what the motivation would be for a {@PersonType}
- to undertake to represent the meritorious claim when
- they have to not only do the work in the {@Location}, but {@DateTime}
- have to do the work for the {@Skill} in getting their
- {@PersonType} to negotiate an agreement with the {@Skill} on
- something that's completely unrelated to the claim
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I guess a --{@PersonType} {@PersonType}: It's -- it's sort of --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: Theres a few answers --{@PersonType} {@PersonType}: -- illogical
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Theres a few answers to that
- {@Organization} applies not only in the {@Organization} context; it
- applies in all civil actions in which -- not sounding in
- tort, in which theres not another specific fee
- provision, brought -- brought by or against the {@Location}
- {@Location}
- {@Organization} intended -- and this is in the statutory findings which precede {@Organization} in section -- I
- believe it's  of the Act; it is -- to diminish the
- financial deterrent on individuals, businesses, and
- organizations caused by the expense of providing -- of
- {@Skill} a {@Location}
- This is --{@PersonType} {@Person}: That sounds like you're -- you have -- the {@PersonType} has an agreement to pay
- the {@PersonType} or the {@PersonType} has paid the {@PersonType}
- It would make sense if the {@PersonType} has paid the {@PersonType} and then
- there is reimbursement under {@Organization} that what -- what
- you're describing would make sense in that situation
- But in most of these situations, the {@PersonType} doesn't have
- the wherewithal to pay the {@PersonType} upfront, of course
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That {@DateTime} be true in the {@Organization} context, but there are many instances in
- which -- this is the -- this is the normal way that,
- you k{@DateTime}, {@PersonType}s and -- and -- and their -- their
- {@PersonType}s work out fee arrangements
- Sometimes {@PersonType}s will pay their {@PersonType} in advance; sometimes they will
- pay as the {@Skill} goes {@PersonType}
- And by the time you have the {@Organization} award the {@PersonType} will have paid all or
- part -- sometimes n{@Quantity} -- but all or part of the -- of
- the fee award
- {@PersonType} {@Person}H: Is it --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@Organization} directed -- the langu{@Quantity} is very clear: {@Location}s shall award to the prevailing party fees and expenses --{@PersonType} {@Person}: And does that mean --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: -- incurred by the party
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: The award goes to the prevailing party
- So, therefore, the {@PersonType}'s fee is income to the {@PersonType} --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: I --{@PersonType} {@Person}: -- is {@Skill}able income to the {@PersonType}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: This is -- the answer to that is complicated and, generally, yes
- The {@Organization} is of the view that {@PersonType} fee awards to prevailing parties, whether
- it's {@Organization} or otherwise, are deemed to be {@Skill}able income
- to the {@PersonType}
- {@DateTime}, the {@PersonType}s, of course, will have an {@Skill}ting deduction for expenses incurred by -- in --
- in the course of producing or collecting income, and
- that was recognized by this {@Location}'s opinion in {@Location}s
- That deduction is, of course, subject to certain limits
- It has to be in excess of  {@Quantity} of the adjusted
- gross income and subject to the alternative minimum {@Skill},
- which wouldn't apply to {@Organization} claims
- But the general answer is yes, it is income when the prevailing party receives a fee
- There is an {@Skill}ting deduction
- However, there's a -- some uncertainty with whether some fee awards when the
- underlying benefit obtained is not {@Skill}able, whether
- that -- the {@Organization} will treat such {@Skill}s to -- the fee
- awards, as --{@PersonType} {@Person}: Like pain and suffering, but that's not --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, so, but also certain Federal benefits, including {@Organization} benefits,
- have a very complicated {@Skill} relationship
- {@Organization} benefits are {@Skill}able in part
- It depends on the size and the amount of other income
- So, the answer is actually quite complicated whether fees are {@Skill}able under {@Organization} in the {@Organization}
- {@Skill} context
- But the general rule is, yes, fee awards to a prevailing party are income and subject
- to --{@PersonType} {@Person}: And then, in turn, income to the {@PersonType} when -- if the {@PersonType} --
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Correct
- Just as, you k{@DateTime}, when I'm -- you k{@DateTime}, I am paid my salary and {@Skill}ed on it,
- and then when I pay for services, the person to whom I
- pay also has income, and they are {@Skill}ed as well
- This is not an unusual situation
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: It seems to me the underlying assumption -- and some of the question would
- have been put to you by the {@Location} -- is that the
- {@Skill} has somehow benefited because the m{@Quantity}y is
- created to {@Skill} the debt
- It really isn't
- It would -- this would be true if an {@PersonType} were suing
- {@Quantity} party and creating a fund, and the {@Skill}
- said, ah, there's the m{@Quantity}y
- In this {@Location}, it's just being paid from {@Quantity} account to the other
- The {@Skill} would be better off if there were no {@Product}
- at all
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That's correct
- If the {@Skill} never had an {@Organization} award, it at least would
- be less of a debt that it could collect
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: It's just paying itself from {@Quantity} account to the other
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That's correct
- The {@Skill} is -- ultimately zeroes out here
- The person that gets the benefit is the prevailing party, because the
- prevailing party has eliminated a debt to the {@Location}
- {@Location} by having that {@Skill} by the {@Organization} award
- So the prevailing party obtains the benefit, which is precisely
- what {@Organization} intended here
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: The {@Skill} zeroes out, but in the course of it, it has taken a
- {@Skill} position in {@Location} against a small business that
- was substantially unjustified
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: And it has paid its {@Organization} award by {@Skill}ting that award against the debt that the business
- owed to the {@Location} {@Location}
- The {@Skill} is -- at {@DateTime}, the balance sheets of the {@Skill}
- have not changed
- And with -- from the perspective of --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: But I think the idea -- well --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: From the perspective of the prevailing party as well
- The prevailing party has an obligation to the {@PersonType}
- Those are the {@PersonType}'s fees incurred which have not yet been paid
- The prevailing party also has an obligation to the
- {@Skill} in the -- in the amount of a debt
- It has income that comes in through the -- through the fee
- award, and whether that goes to {@Skill} the debt to the
- {@Skill} or {@Skill} the -- for use to pay the {@PersonType},
- the prevailing party ultimately gets the benefit of that
- fee award
- And the {@Skill} has paid the {@Organization} award
- as required by statute
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Do you happen to k{@DateTime} how much the -- the {@Organization} typically collects in a year
- under these {@Organization} {@Skill}s? Does it put a dent in the Federal deficit? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: We don't, and the reason we don't is because each {@Quantity}ncy that -- which is the subject of
- an {@Organization} order submits to {@Organization} a {@Skill} request
- based on that order, and they check miscellaneous
- {@Skill}
- That {@Quantity}ncy doesn't k{@DateTime} whether that {@Skill} is {@Skill}
- {@Organization} receives that -- that request of {@Skill} and sees that it's a miscellaneous {@Skill},
- checks it against a debt, and {@DateTime} {@Skill}
- But {@Organization} doesn't k{@DateTime} that the miscellaneous {@Skill} was an {@Organization}
- award
- So we don't have any {@Skill} that we can point to, to say how often this -- this occurs
- I can say that the financial man{@Quantity}ment service executes {@Quantity}
- -- over {@Quantity} {@Skill}s per year, and that {@Skill}s
- of those {@Skill}s account for $
- billion
- So about {@Quantity}-tenths of  {@Quantity} of {@Skill}s from the Federal
- Government result in {@Skill}s
- Id like to reserve the balance of my time
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Thank you, {@PersonType}
- Mr
- {@Person}
- ORAL ARGUMENT OF {@Person}
- {@Person} ON BEHALF OF THE {@PersonType} {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Mr
- {@PersonType}, {@DateTime} it please the {@Location}: Id like to discuss with you this morning {@Quantity} reasons why Catherine {@Person}, and not the
- {@Skill}, is entitled to receive the fee for the {@Skill}
- services she performed, that {@Organization} invited her to
- perform, to show that the {@Skill}'s position was
- {@Skill}ly err{@Quantity}ous and was not even substantially
- justified
- And my {@Quantity} point arises from your question, Justice {@Person}
- You asked whether State {@Skill} determines who has the priorities here in terms of
- {@Skill}, if I understood
- And the answer is that actually Federal {@Skill} determines that, specifically the
- Debt Collection {@Organization}provement Act and regulations
- The Act requires mutuality of a debt between the {@PersonType} and
- the {@Skill} before the {@Skill} can {@Skill}
- And the regulations, which Ill quote in just an instant,
- require that before {@Skill} can occur, the {@Skill} must
- look to who has the beneficial interest in the {@Skill}
- In other words, who is entitled to benefit from it
- Specifically,  C
- (b), which is
- quoted at p{@Quantity}  of the red brief, defines, quote,
- "{@Skill}," close quote, as withholding funds to satisfy
- a debt owed by a {@PersonType}
- And "{@PersonType}" -- and this is critical -- is defined as the same -- in the same
- regulation, also quoted at p{@Quantity}  of our reply brief,
- as "the person entitled" -- as the person entitled to
- the benefit of all or part of a {@Skill}
- In other words, not the {@Skill} title {@PersonType} if there is a
- difference, but the person with the beneficial interest
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: The prevailing party gets the benefit in the sense that she is relieved of
- the debt she owed to the {@Skill}
- That's a real benefit
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, Your {@Skill}, I think that's a benefit -- true, that's a benefit, I agree; but that's
- not a benefit, I don't think, in the sense of who --
- because the question is who has the beneficial interest
- in the fee {@Skill}? And when we look to that question, because that's what's at issue here, is the fee {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Isn't this argument circular? The -- the issue is who is -- to whom is this {@Skill} to be made
- And if it's to be made to the --the {@PersonType}, then it's not for the beneficial interest
- of the -- of the {@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@Quantity} responses, if I could,
- Justice {@Person}: {@Quantity}, the word "{@Skill}" gets thrown around a lot in the {@Product}
- It can mean {@Quantity} separate things
- It can mean who receives the {@Skill} {@Quantity}; in other words, who is the check mailed to; or it can mean
- who the check is ultimately entitled to -- who is
- entitled to benefit from it
- And the {@Skill}'s -- my {@Quantity} point is the {@Skill}'s reply brief at p{@Quantity}  to  concedes
- that, but for the {@Skill}'s alleged right to {@Skill},
- the {@PersonType} does indeed have the beneficial interest in
- the {@PersonType}'s fee
- And the {@Skill} gives {@Quantity} reasons, and only {@Quantity} reasons, why its alleged right
- to {@Skill} trumps the {@PersonType}'s beneficial interest
- The {@Quantity} reason the {@Skill} gives is the {@Skill} says that the -- the constructive trust, which
- the {@Skill} ack{@DateTime}ledges exists in the -- in -- in
- favor of the {@PersonType} with respect to the fee {@Skill},
- does not arise until the instant the fee reaches the
- {@PersonType}
- And that's true, but that's not the point
- The point is the {@PersonType} had the beneficial interest in the fee, which had to precede the
- moment the fee reached the {@PersonType}, if it's payable to
- the {@PersonType} in the sense of "sent to
- " The beneficial interest had to precede that in order for a constructive
- trust to arise
- The {@Skill}'s {@Quantity} argument --{@PersonType} BREYER: On the {@Quantity} {@Quantity}, imagine that the -- a trust owes some m{@Quantity}y to the {@Skill}
- {@DateTime}, suppose a {@PersonType} representing the trust recovers
- {@DateTime}, they recover on a separate debt, okay? Separate debt? {@Quantity}
- That m{@Quantity}y goes to the trust
- Right? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: If -- I'm not --{@PersonType} BREYER: The trust {@Quantity} owes -- the trust owes $, to the {@Skill}
- The trust then independently recovers $ from the {@Skill} on a
- different matter
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: The {@Skill} couldn't {@Skill} that? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Of course it could
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Yes
- Of course it could
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: But the trust is not a person entitled to the benefit of the {@Skill}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well --{@PersonType} BREYER: The {@PersonType} of the trust are entitled to the benefit of the {@Skill}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: If I understood your hypothetical, if the trust is entitled to $, then the
- trust I think would be entitled to the benefit of the
- {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} BREYER: It's not entitled to the benefit of the $
- The trust holds m{@Quantity}y for the benefit of the {@PersonType} of the trust
- So --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: I --{@PersonType} BREYER: -- it cant -- you agree that that couldn't be? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well --{@PersonType} BREYER: Yes, and once you agree that that couldn't be, I think you are in trouble on
- your {@Quantity} argument
- I'm not sure
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Okay
- I don't think so, because if we are talking about {@Skill}s to persons, you k{@DateTime},
- if a person -- if a person owes a debt of $,,
- receives $ on the debt, the person receives the
- benefit of that $
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: I --{@PersonType} BREYER: Well, similarly, the -- the guy -- the {@PersonType} here receives the benefit of the m{@Quantity}y
- that he has just gotten from the {@Skill}, including
- the {@PersonType}'s fees
- It happens that he can't keep those {@PersonType}'s fees, just as the trust can't keep the
- He has to give the {@PersonType}'s fees to the {@PersonType}, just as the trust eventually has to give the $ to the
- {@PersonType}
- So I'm simply saying -- drawing a
- parallel, which -- go on to the next issue
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: All right, Your {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, let me -- can trusts -- can trusts recover {@Organization} fees? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I don't k{@DateTime}, Your {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Yes, I don't either
- Im looking at the definition
- It doesn't say "trust
- " It says a lot of other things, like corporation,
- association, unit of {@Skill}
- I just don't --{@PersonType} KENNEDY: Im having trouble with this aspect, and it {@DateTime} -- {@DateTime} be that it varies from
- State to State
- But as a general matter, under State {@Skill}, let's say that the {@PersonType} makes a contingency fee
- arrangement with a {@PersonType} to sue the {@PersonType} and wins
- It's a {@Quantity}-{@Quantity} contingent fee
- The -- the {@PersonType} already owes the {@PersonType} $,
- It would seem to me under the general principle of {@Skill} that
- the {@PersonType} has to only pay $,, and the {@PersonType}
- is not going to get his full fee
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Thats --{@PersonType} KENNEDY: And that's just --that's just the {@Skill} of {@Skill}s
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That's true
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: Because again, it's the same party
- If they created m{@Quantity}y by suing some {@Quantity}
- person, then that's different
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I think that's true
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: And -- and so I -- it seems to me that what you're -- what you're asking for
- is just contrary to the standard {@Skill} of {@Skill}s
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, Your {@Skill}, with what I --{@PersonType} KENNEDY: And it's even worse because the Federal statute says that there shall be
- this {@Skill} {@Quantity} as a matter of priority
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Actually, Your {@Skill}, the Federal statute provides for {@Skill} in accordance with
- regulations to be issued by the {@Organization}
- And those {@Organization} regulations were what I
- quoted right at the beginning of my argument
- We have to look at who is entitled to the benefit of the
- {@Skill}, not the benefit in a generalized sense of the
- {@Skill}{@Product}
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: Well, in the generalized sense of -- of common {@Skill} of {@Skill}s, as I've described
- to it, sure, the {@PersonType} has a beneficial interest, but
- he's not going to be able to collect it vis--vis the
- {@PersonType} who is entitled to an {@Skill}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- And the difference, Your {@Skill}, is that in your hypothetical were talking about
- {@Quantity} sum of m{@Quantity}y thats recovered in the name of the
- {@PersonType}
- In this situation, were talking about a statutory fee award, which is created only based on the
- work of the {@PersonType} and which is labeled an {@PersonType}'s
- fee and separate from the benefit --{@PersonType} BREYER: Well, how is it different? Look
- This, what I was talking about, has nothing to do
- With {@Organization}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: It has to do with when the {@Skill}'s allowed to {@Skill} some m{@Quantity}y
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: And it's allowed to {@Skill} some m{@Quantity}y when the m{@Quantity}y is m{@Quantity}y that it would otherwise
- give to a {@PersonType}
- All right? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: And then you've defined "{@PersonType}" as a person who has some beneficial interest in
- that m{@Quantity}y
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: And I think that the {@PersonType} here has no more and no less beneficial interest whether
- he's a person or whether he's a trust
- That was my point
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I understand, Your {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Okay
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: And my point about the statute is simply that the statute is subject to the regulation
- which looks to who's entitled to benefit
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Okay, let's take the regulation: "A person who is entitled to the benefit of all or part of the {@Skill}
- " Ultimately, isn't it the {@PersonType} who has recovered that is entitled to the
- benefit, because this m{@Quantity}y is given to him in order
- that he can meet a financial obligation that he owes to
- the {@PersonType}? I mean, if this didn't exist, he'd owe the {@PersonType} and have to pony it up out of his own pocket, no? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Not so, Your {@Skill}, in {@Organization} {@Location}s, which this is, and in {@PersonType} {@Location}s,
- which together account for more than  {@Quantity} of all
- {@Organization} awards
- In {@Organization} {@Location}s,  U
- (b)(), set out in our appendix, makes it a Federal
- crime for any {@PersonType} to charge, receive, demand, or
- collect a fee {@Skill} directly from a {@PersonType}, other than
- under past -- the  U
- past-due benefits,
- {@Quantity}, or {@Organization}
- And this is a critical difference
- In the non-{@Organization}, in the non-{@Organization}, non-{@PersonType}
- contexts, you k{@DateTime}, about  {@Quantity} of {@Location}s, you've got
- -- conceivably, you've got, often, {@PersonType}s paying {@PersonType}s
- on a traditional pay-as-you-go basis
- But in a {@Organization} {@Location} or a {@PersonType} {@Location} --{@PersonType} {@Person}: And in those {@Location}s, you agree the {@Skill} can be made? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Absolutely
- Absolutely
- The difference here in all these {@Organization} and {@PersonType} {@Location}s is that the {@PersonType} is
- barred by {@Skill} from receiving m{@Quantity}y on a
- pay-as-you-go basis
- So the {@PersonType} has never been paid
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: In exchange for getting  {@Quantity} of the recovery? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: No
- Actually, Your {@Skill}, in exchange for showing in Federal {@Location}, if I understand
- your question
- I hope I do
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: My understanding is that the ordinary {@Skill} to the {@PersonType} for {@Organization}
- benefits gained for the {@PersonType} is  {@Quantity} of the
- recovery to the {@PersonType} paid directly to the {@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That's true
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: So that, just as a background in this {@Location}, did Ms
- {@Person} get that
- {@Quantity}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: No, Your {@Skill}
- There was no  {@Quantity} fee here
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: And that was because it was too small to be bothered with? What was the reason? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: She did not apply for a  {@Quantity} fee
- It would have been quite small, had she received it
- It would have been much smaller than the {@Organization} fee
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: And she could keep only {@Quantity} from the --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: She could keep only the larger of the {@Quantity}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Had she received the {@Organization} fee, she could have kept it
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: {@Quantity} of the difficulties with your position is that {@Organization} did exempt a number
- of Federal {@Skill}s from the {@Skill}, but it didn't
- exempt {@Organization} fees
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- And the -- there are {@Quantity} points there, Your {@Skill}
- I mean, {@Organization} fees -- I'm not claiming all {@Organization} fees are exempt
- As I just said --spoke with you, Justice {@Person}, if the -- in a non-{@Organization}
- {@Skill}, non-{@PersonType} {@Location} where the {@PersonType} has paid
- the {@PersonType} and then an {@Organization} fee comes down, thats
- clearly subject to {@Skill}
- You have to look to that regulation and who is entitled to the benefit of the fee
- {@Skill}
- And the reason that the Debt Collection {@Organization}provement Act doesn't address this in  is that in
- , the {@Skill} had never taken the position that
- {@PersonType} fees were subject to {@Skill} in {@Organization}
- or {@PersonType} {@Location}s
- And in fact, in , there were {@Quantity} {@Location} of appeals decisions on the question of
- whether a {@PersonType} could {@Skill} a statutory fee award:
- {@Person} -- these are all of our {@Product} -- {@Person}, Fourth
- {@Location}, ; Duncan -- I'm sorry, {@Person} is Fifth
- {@Location}, ; Duncan, Fourth {@Location}, ; Curtis,
- Eighth {@Location},
- All those {@Location}s said that the {@PersonType} {@DateTime} not {@Skill} a statutory fee award against the {@PersonType}'s
- debt because the fee is for the {@PersonType}
- Thats why {@Organization} couldn't have conceivably thought to address it
- And some of the questions take me toward the point that you asked about before, Justice {@Person} --
- {@PersonType} {@Person}
- And you suggested, or you said, that {@Organization} says: Pay to the prevailing party
- If I heard you correctly
- In fact, Your {@Skill}, the langu{@Quantity} of the statute is, quote, "award to the prevailing party
- fees and other expenses
- incurred by that party
- " And the {@Quantity} parts that we haven't really
- addressed yet are that what is awarded is {@PersonType}'s
- fees
- And this "incurred by" langu{@Quantity} -- with respect to that {@PersonType}'s fee langu{@Quantity}, "{@PersonType}'s fees" has a
- traditional meaning
- It's a meaning this {@Location} has recognized in all those {@Location}s bullet-pointed at p{@Quantity}s
- to  of our {@Product}
- It's a fee earned by and paid to an {@PersonType}
- And in {@Person} v
- {@Person} in , this {@Location} specifically described the real parties in
- interest in {@PersonType}'s fees {@Skill} as the {@PersonType}s,
- recognizing the reality that {@PersonType} fees go to
- {@PersonType}s
- In addition, the langu{@Quantity} "incurred by that party" -- what does it mean here? Well, outside of {@Organization}, it could mean -- it does mean, I think -- m{@Quantity}y the
- {@PersonType} takes out and pays to the {@PersonType}
- We k{@DateTime} in {@Organization} {@Location}s and {@PersonType} {@Location}s it can't mean
- that, because that's il{@Skill}
- That's a Federal crime if the {@PersonType} does it
- So what does it mean? Well, the {@Skill} concedes at p{@Quantity}  of its reply brief that that langu{@Quantity}
- "incurred by" a prevailing party is supported by the
- {@PersonType}'s implied or express obligation to pay the
- {@PersonType} the fee received
- So this is where the {@Skill}'s argument is circular, I think,
- Justice {@Person}, in the sense that that "incurred by"
- langu{@Quantity} only is satisfied and an {@Organization} award only {@DateTime} be
- made where the {@PersonType} has the express or implied
- obligation to pay the {@PersonType}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, you say that in {@Organization} the {@PersonType} is forbidden to accept
- pay-as-you-go? Is --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, Your {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: But that doesn't mean that there is not either an express or an implied contract
- between the {@PersonType} and the {@Organization} {@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I agree
- That's what I was trying to say
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, but if there is that implied contract, then it is an obligation of the
- {@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, that's what I was trying to say, Your {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, I don't see how that leads you where you want to go
- Then the {@Skill} given to the {@PersonType} does indeed benefit the {@PersonType} by --
- by paying off an obligation that the {@Organization}
- {@PersonType} has
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, but that obligation exists only to the extent of the {@Organization} fee
- It's not a separate obligation
- The {@PersonType} can't turn around and go
- against the {@PersonType}
- I mean, (b)() prohi{@Quantity}s the {@PersonType} going against the {@PersonType} for any fee other than
- the (b) fee, which is separate, if there is a (b)
- fee, or the {@Organization} fee
- And when --{@PersonType} {@PersonType}: Is it --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: We have been talking -- I'm sorry
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: Just so I'm clarifying, is it your position -- and this is something I want to
- ask the {@Skill} as well -- that once the {@Organization} fee is
- awarded, the {@PersonType} couldn't sue the {@PersonType} later even
- in an {@Skill} situation for re{@Skill}, because by statute
- you view them as blocked from --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: -- from seeking anything other than the {@Organization} fee or the  fee? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, that's what (b)() says, Your {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: So that once the {@Skill} happens, the {@PersonType}, under -- even if the {@PersonType} had
- other m{@Quantity}y, the {@PersonType} would be blocked from going
- after it? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, Your {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: Because by the terms of the statute they can only seek the {@Organization} fee?
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: They can only seek what? {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: Either the {@Organization} fee or the  fee
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, and we have been talking as if {@Organization} fees and (b) fees are sort of contemporaneous
- in every {@Location}
- In fact, the {@Skill} cited at p{@Quantity}  of the red brief is that  {@Quantity} of Federal {@Location} {@Organization}
- {@Skill} {@Location}s result in a remand
- Only  {@Quantity} result in an award of benefits
- So there are going to be far more {@Organization} fees in Federal {@Location} than there ever are (b) fees
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: Do you calculate the fee under either the {@Organization} Act or {@Organization}, depending
- on the {@Location}? Do you ever calculate it under both so that you get some under each? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, Your {@Skill}
- And that's --{@PersonType} KENNEDY: The -- the -- you calculate it under both so you get some under each? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: No, section  says how this works, of the -- of {@Organization}
- It says if there are {@Quantity} fees, the {@PersonType} keeps the larger fee --{@PersonType} KENNEDY: Right
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: -- and sends the smaller to the {@PersonType} and vice versa
- And thats the situation, for {@Event}ple, where you could have an {@Skill} of an {@Organization} fee in a
- {@Organization} {@Location}
- Let's say there is a (b) fee that's $,
- Let's say there is an {@Organization} fee that is $,
- Under section , that -- the {@PersonType} doesn't keep that $,
- That $, winds up in the {@PersonType}'s pocket
- The {@Skill} can {@Skill} that
- That's --that's what integrates all this discussion weve been
- having about {@Organization} fees not being exempt
- We have to look to the beneficial interest
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: In what {@Quantity} of the {@Organization} {@Location}s where the {@PersonType} prevails is
- there an {@Organization} fee? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Forty-{@Quantity} {@Quantity}
- No, that's not right
- It's about  {@Quantity}
- And I get that from combining {@Quantity} numbers
- There are , {@Organization} awards per year
- That's red brief p{@Quantity}
- And there are about , {@Organization} civil {@Location}s per year
- That's green brief p{@Quantity}
- Fifty-{@Quantity} -- , divided by , is  {@Quantity}
- And this bring me to the point the {@Skill} was making in suggesting that an {@PersonType} at
- the beginning of a {@Location} could never k{@DateTime} whether or
- not there -- there is going to be an {@Organization} fee, because,
- you k{@DateTime}, you can't k{@DateTime} at the beginning, they argue,
- what position the {@Skill} will take, whether or not
- the {@Skill}'s position is substantially justified or
- not
- Well -- and the {@Skill} cites {@Person}/{@Location} from  from this {@Location}, in which
- this {@Location} said exactly that -- {@Person} v
- {@Location}
- {@Person} v
- {@Location} is outside the {@Organization} context, outside the {@PersonType} context, so
- {@Person} v
- {@Location} is in this less than  {@Quantity}
- category of {@Location}s under {@Organization} which are not {@Organization}
- {@Skill} or {@PersonType}
- In a {@Organization} {@Location} or a {@PersonType} {@Location}, the {@PersonType} has the record before proceeding into
- {@Location}, before deciding whether to proceed into {@Location}
- And the {@PersonType} can look at that record, read it, and
- have a pretty good idea of whether or not the {@Skill}
- position might be substantially justified or not
- I don't ask you to take my word for any of this
- Let me tell you what the {@Skill} shows
- The {@Skill}, Justice {@Person} -- this is where the  {@Quantity} of Federal {@Organization} {@Location}s result
- in an {@Organization} award
- If it's  {@Quantity}, that's quite a high number of {@Location}s in which the {@Skill}'s position
- is found substantially -- not substantially justified as
- well as {@Skill}ly err{@Quantity}ous
- In {@PersonType} {@Location}s, it's even worse
- The {@Location} of {@PersonType} Appeal Web site -- this the number of
- {@Location}s -- all together -- number of dispositions per year
- and the number of {@Organization} awards
- And for  and , if you add up the numbers, out of all the {@PersonType}
- disability {@Location}s filed,  {@Quantity}, -, result in an
- {@Organization} award
- So theres quite a large number of {@Location}s in which -- in -- in a {@PersonType} context or {@Organization}
- {@Skill} context where the {@Skill}'s position is
- found not to be --{@PersonType} BREYER: I don't understand your earlier point
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I'm sorry
- {@PersonType} BREYER: {@Organization}agine that if Joe Smith is in a lot of financial trouble
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: His house is being foreclosed on --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: -- all his {@Location} accounts are attached
- Then he gets some m{@Quantity}y from the {@Skill} and -- including an {@Organization} fee
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: And it's $, of m{@Quantity}y and , for the fee
- They put it in his {@Location} account
- It was attached, good-bye, nobody sees the m{@Quantity}y, because
- it's whoever attached it got the m{@Quantity}y
- Is that
- possible? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Are we talking about the {@Skill}? {@PersonType} BREYER: I'm making this up
- I'm not talking about the {@Skill}
- I'm saying the {@Skill} paid him , plus , in an {@Organization} fee, and
- the {@Location} got all the m{@Quantity}y because it had attached his
- {@Location} account
- Is that possible? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Is this in a {@Organization} --{@PersonType} BREYER: I'm making it up
- No
- It has nothing to do with -- I'm just making up --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: -- a hypothetical
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, it is
- Sorry
- {@PersonType} BREYER: All right? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: You follow that
- Those are the facts
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I think so
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Okay
- So {@DateTime}, Joe Smith is doing much better
- Couldn't the {@PersonType} {@DateTime} sue him for the $,, say Id like it? It went to the {@Location} because they had attached the {@Location} account
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Outside the {@Organization} context, yes, I think so
- {@PersonType} BREYER: All right
- {@DateTime}, suppose it happened to be that that ,,  for the {@Quantity} and  for
- the other, came from {@Organization}
- Then how does that make a difference? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The {@Location} could not take it because of the anti-assignment provision --{@PersonType} BREYER: It couldn't take ,? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Couldn't take any of it under --{@PersonType} BREYER: Couldn't take any of it
- Because of? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: --  U
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Is that in here? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes,  U
- -- it's cited, if its not quoted -- prohi{@Quantity}s assignment of {@Organization}
- {@Skill} benefits
- But, Justice {@Person}, if I --{@PersonType} BREYER: And the {@Organization} fee counts as a {@Organization} benefit? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Oh, I'm sorry
- I thought we were outside the {@Organization} context
- {@PersonType} BREYER: I changed it and said, {@DateTime}, how does it matter if its {@Organization}? (Laughter
- ) {@Organization}
- {@Person}: If it's an {@Organization} fee in a {@Organization} context, the {@Location} cannot take that because of
- the Federal -- well, because the {@PersonType} -- the
- {@Skill} admits the constructive trust exists in favor of the {@PersonType} with respect to those funds
- {@PersonType} BREYER: If you win this {@Location}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: No
- The {@Skill} says -- has said that in its reply brief
- {@PersonType} BREYER: In other words -- in other words, no {@Quantity} can attach? No {@Quantity} can -- no {@Quantity} get the {@Organization} fee by attaching the {@Location} account of the {@PersonType}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Okay
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: And I wanted to get back to the point you asked, Justice {@Person} --{@PersonType} BREYER: Well, skip my points
- Theyre too complicated
- (Laughter
- ) {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well -- but during -- during Mr
- {@Person}'s argument, you asked about this -- this
- re{@Skill} agreement
- The concept of a re{@Skill} agreement being any use to a {@PersonType} who is thinking
- about taking {@Quantity} of these {@Location}s is fanciful for {@Quantity}
- reasons: Number {@Quantity}, SSI benefits by statute are limited to, quote, "{@Quantity}d, blind, and {@PersonType} people who
- have little or no m{@Quantity}y
- " So, I don't k{@DateTime} where the {@PersonType} or blind or {@Quantity}d person is going to get the m{@Quantity}y to enter into
- any re{@Skill} agreement
- But the {@Quantity} reason it's fanciful is that the {@PersonType} only has  days from final {@Quantity}ncy action
- to file the {@Location} in Federal {@Location}
- And, so, there is  days to, you k{@DateTime}, meet with the {@PersonType} and try to
- get an answer out of the {@Skill}
- I've never tried to do this -- I don't k{@DateTime} any{@Quantity} who has -- but I don't
- think youre going to get much of an answer at  days
- asking the {@Skill} to do this so the {@PersonType} can
- then recover a fee
- Finally, theres -- theres a critical point here that I need to get to, which is that I think
- {@Organization} has told us exactly what this langu{@Quantity} means
- Here's why
- In , {@Organization} enacts {@Organization} and uses this section  langu{@Quantity} which talks about who gets the fee,
- large or smaller fee
- Okay
- In , {@Organization} extends {@Organization} to {@PersonType} claims
- And when it does that, in  U
- , {@Organization} uses the same langu{@Quantity}, down to the exact commas in the same place, that it has d{@Quantity} in
- During this entire period -- and here's why that's important -- during that entire period from
- to , and indeed continuing many years after that,
- but for purposes here, , the administration is every
- time paying the {@PersonType}s fee to the {@PersonType} under
- {@Organization}
- And so when {@Organization} in  uses the same langu{@Quantity} for {@PersonType} {@Organization} claims that it used for
- {@Organization} {@Organization} claims  years earlier,
- {@Organization}, as a matter of {@Skill}, is incorporating the
- settled administrative {@Skill} --{@PersonType} {@Person}: I thought the -- I thought the {@Skill} said they only did that when --
- when the {@Location} directed that it be paid to the {@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Mr
- {@Person} was talking about from  on
- From  -- from  to , every {@Organization} fee went to the {@PersonType}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Because there was no {@Skill} in the picture because the {@Skill} wasn't
- {@Skill}ting
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@Quantity} responses, Your {@Skill}: The {@Skill} came into the picture in , but the {@Skill}
- says it wasn't practical to
- Even if you grant them that point, the {@Quantity}ncy had to make -- totally apart from
- {@Skill}, the {@Quantity}ncy had to decide who these fees should
- be paid to under section  -- I mean under {@Organization}
- The {@Skill} had to say, who does this statute say fees should be paid to? {@DateTime}, had the {@Skill} said, well, fees go to the {@PersonType}, says, you
- k{@DateTime}, award to the prevailing party, fees and other
- expenses, we are going to pay {@PersonType}'s fees to
- {@PersonType}s, which had never happened
- But had the {@Skill} said that -- that's not what they said
- They look at the statute
- They look at the fact that the {@PersonType} earned the fees, and they say we
- are going to pay these fees to the {@PersonType}
- So that's whats going on at the time {@Organization} in  copies its
- langu{@Quantity} --{@PersonType} {@Person}: But {@Organization} has provided in some statutes, the {@Organization} Act itself, ,
- that you quoted, for the fee to be paid directly to the
- {@PersonType}
- Here it used different langu{@Quantity}; it said pay the prevailing party
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Just {@Quantity} points, Justice {@Person}: Number {@Quantity}, we get back to this question about does {@Skill} mean who receives the check
- or who is entitled to benefit from it? Number {@Quantity}, {@Organization} doesn't say pay to the party
- {@Organization} doesn't use the phrase {@Skill};  says {@Skill} to the {@PersonType}
- {@Organization} doesn't say that, "{@Skill}," at all
- The only place you find "pay" in {@Organization} is where it says the {@Skill}
- cannot be required to pay a {@Skill} fee

- fees to include quote, "{@PersonType} fees," close quote
- I'm finishing my sentence, Your {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Go a{@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Thank you
- And -- and so {@Skill} isn't even in {@Organization}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Thank you, {@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Thank you very much, Your {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Mr
- {@Person}, you have  minutes remaining
- REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY {@Person} ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I believe I heard {@PersonType} concede that {@Organization} fees outside of the {@Organization} context
- are payable to the prevailing party and therefore
- subject to {@Skill}
- That's true
- {@Organization} does not draw a distinction between {@Organization} fees and other types
- of fees
- Section  uses the same langu{@Quantity}, {@Location} shall award to the prevailing party fees and other
- expenses
- I believe that disposes of this {@Location}
- {@Quantity}, {@PersonType} relies on a definition of representative {@PersonType} in the {@Skill} regulations
- That's addressed at reply -- our reply, p{@Quantity} , footnote
- A representative {@PersonType} -- as the Federal Register provisions
- that relate to this make clear, it refers to things like
- {@PersonType}s, it refers to things like {@PersonType}s, where the
- beneficial interest is not that of the {@PersonType} or the
- {@PersonType} but the {@PersonType} and the child
- It would be entirely unworkable if any time that a {@PersonType} owes some debt that {@Quantity} party might
- claim an interest to, that the {@Skill} would have to
- find out the {@PersonType}'s finances and obligations in order
- to execute an {@Skill}
- It's simply not the way the {@Skill} program was designed, and it's not reflected in
- the regulation
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: Counsel, is your adversary correct that under (b) --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: ()
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: -- (b)(), that if these {@PersonType}s -- if any {@PersonType} attempts to collect from
- a {@Organization} or {@PersonType} {@PersonType} any fees outside
- of those granted --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: No
- Section (b) of the {@Organization}, which is reproduced on a of our appendix, states that
- section (b)(), the provision you were talking about,
- shall not apply with respect to any such award, meaning
- any award under {@Organization}, so long as where the {@PersonType}
- receives fees, the smaller fee is returned
- So --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Counsel, do you -- do you dispute your {@PersonType}'s statement that  {@Quantity} of
- the time in {@Organization} {@Location}s the {@Skill}'s
- position is unjustified, and  {@Quantity} of the time in
- {@PersonType} {@Location}s? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, I think that reflects the stakes often, Your {@Skill}
- Oftentimes the {@Skill} does not con{@Skill}, for instance, a $, {@Organization} award
- and because it's the {@Skill}, it has to --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: So whenever it really makes a difference --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: No --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: --  {@Quantity} of the time the {@Skill}'s position is substantially unjustified? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: In {@Location}s -- in the {@Location} context, the number is not quite that large, but theres a substantial
- number of {@Location}s at the {@Location} of appeals --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: What number would you accept? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: It was, I believe, in the order of either  or {@DateTime}be slightly more than  {@Quantity}
- It might be
- But the number is substantial that you get a reversal, and in almost all of those {@Location}s, {@Organization} --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, that's really startling, isn't it? In {@Skill} with veterans, the {@Skill} more often than not takes a position that is
- substantially unjustified? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: It is an unfortunate number, Your {@Skill}
- And it is -- it's accurate
- {@PersonType} that last hired is laid off, on the ground that if
- {@Location} had d{@Quantity} what it was supposed to do, this person
- would have had the job long ago and would be higher up
- on the seniority list? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Let me give you {@Quantity} responses to that
- The {@Quantity} answer is that the statute of limitations is  days after every use, and it's no
- longer
- So for whatever it is, if you violate Title VII, the statute of limitations is  days
- If there is a use that goes into the future, it's  days
- after the last use
- Right {@DateTime}, {@Location} has stopped using that
- The {@Product} are closed
- No {@Quantity} else can challenge this
- To your specific question about how would it work if there was a layoff arrangement, the proposed --
- the remedy order in this {@Location} -- it's not in effect
- because we are where we are -- but the remedy order in
- this {@Location} includes shutting down the use of this, but it
- also has provisions for seniority to in fact address, I
- believe, exactly the circumstances you just described,
- Justice {@Person}
- So I believe that is contemplated and handled in the remedial order
- The issue about the {@Skill} here, though, is that if you don't say that a use, in fact, can be
- {@PersonType} challenged, a use of something un{@Skill}ful can be
- challenged, what you could end up with here is that
- {@Location} would then take the mess{@Quantity} that it's okay once
- they are past the {@Quantity}  days, and they could just go
- on using the discriminatory cutoff score over and over
- and over again, and that is inconsistent with the
- overall {@Skill} of what Title VII is trying to root out
- of our {@Skill} and in our workplace
- {@PersonType} STEVENS: Mr
- {@Person}, can I ask this general question? Am I correct that each {@PersonType} in the {@PersonType} group who did not make the well-{@PersonType}
- has a cause of action as though he had been refused
- {@Skill} when any{@Quantity} else is hired? There were  people hired, as I understand
- Did each {@Quantity} of those {@Skill}s give everybody else in the {@Event} a cause of
- action? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The group of the black {@PersonType} {@PersonType}s that are in the {@PersonType} category,
- but the {@PersonType} category is {@PersonType} as the other
- category -- every time the {@Location} made decisions about
- filling jobs in the {@Location}, it excluded every
- single {@Quantity} of those {@PersonType}s, even though they were
- {@PersonType}
- So every single {@Quantity} was excluded
- So they all have a cause of action because they were excluded and that clearly fits very easily
- {@PersonType} within how --{@PersonType} STEVENS: But surely they couldn't all recover, because there was only {@Quantity} job available
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: No
- That's correct
- That's about what the remedy would be
- So the remedy and -- you k{@DateTime}, obviously wouldn't be to give all of them jobs
- That's not the remedy, and that wasnt the remedy that's
- sought -- was sought here
- But they were all excluded from consideration, and that's a violation of Title VII's
- disparate {@Skill} prohi{@Quantity}ion
- So they all have a cause of action
- The way the remedy would work --{@PersonType} STEVENS: What is -- what is the remedy other than saying change your {@Event}? What is -- say {@Quantity} person sues and asks for dam{@Quantity}s, what
- would the remedy be for a single {@PersonType} who was not
- hired at the time somebody else was hired? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: It {@DateTime} be very little
- So if it's a single {@PersonType} who sues and not a {@Event} -- this
- is a {@Event}
- So if a single {@PersonType} sues, the remedy would be to stop using the un{@Skill}ful cutoff score, okay,
- and then to figure out what would have happened if that
- un{@Skill}ful cutoff score hadn't have occurred, and that
- would have created a very miniscule chance of ever
- becoming a {@PersonType} and perhaps turning that into
- {@PersonType} some sort of dam{@Quantity} award, but it would be miniscule
- In the actual event, the award includes some actual jobs being allocated to the , {@PersonType} of the
- {@Event} -- it was  -- to be decided upon in some random
- way that they would be hired
- But that's how it would work
- But they are all clearly injured when they are all excluded from consideration in all  rounds, in
- violation of Title VII
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: But that -- each --each {@PersonType} {@PersonType} who did not get a job because
- the well-{@PersonType} {@Quantity} did has a new cause of action, I
- guess, every time somebody is hired from the -- the
- well-{@PersonType} {@Location}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Every time --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: In other words, somebody is hired, that constitutes discrimination
- against the {@PersonType} black {@PersonType} who was not
- hired, and then another -- then somebody else is
- hired -- each time it's a new cause of action? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: They had  rounds of {@Skill} --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Yes
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: -- that are relevant to this {@Location}
- There are other rounds afterwards
- They exhaust the {@Quantity} category
- But in the  rounds of {@Skill}, when in every {@Quantity} of those rounds the un{@Skill}ful cutoff score is used, that is
- {@PersonType} action upon the results
- That is a limitation
- You k{@DateTime}, that is the use of something that causes an adverse {@Skill}
- on the basis of {@Event} -- and, yes --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Yes, so they would have a new cause of action, sure
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Thats a cause of action
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: {@DateTime}, but they -- but if  days go from the {@Quantity} round of {@Skill}, they
- don't -- they cannot sort of piggyback that onto a later
- cause of action
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes, if they sue -- in this {@Location}, the {@Organization} charge was filed after the {@Quantity} round
- of {@Skill}, and in this {@Location} then, therefore, no remedy
- can take account of the {@Quantity} round of {@Skill}
- If they had sued only on the {@Quantity} round of {@Skill}, no remedy
- could take account of those forg{@Quantity} opportunities
- So, that would also play out in how the remedial order would
- work
- And I think I want to reserve the rest of my time
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Thank you, {@PersonType}
- Mr
- {@Person}
- ORAL ARGUMENT OF {@Person}
- {@Location} ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE {@PersonType}
- {@PersonType} {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Thank you, Mr
- {@PersonType}, and {@DateTime} it please the {@Location}: As the questions I think reveal, I think the bottom line question in this {@Location} is whether or not
- under the text of Title VII there was a present
- violation in each of the  rounds of {@Skill} when the
- City of {@Location} relied on its concededly discriminatory
- {@Skill} to exclude the {@PersonType} from consideration
- And we think that Title VII has {@Quantity} mutually reinforcing
- provisions in it, each of which point to the same
- conclusion
- A violation of Title VII occurred in this {@Location} when {@Location}, in each of those  rounds, used its
- {@Skill} {@Event} with -- and caused a disparate {@Skill},
- thereby limiting the {@Skill} opportunities of certain
- {@PersonType}s
- {@Location} gave an ability {@Skill} and relied on that ability {@Skill} in a way that Title VII forbids
- It took action upon the results of that discriminatory {@Skill}
- in a way that ar{@Quantity}rarily excluded {@PersonType} {@PersonType}s
- from being hired
- Justice {@Person}, I think -- in response to your question, I think our position follows entirely from the
- text of the statute
- Were not as concerned about the {@Skill} consequences, though we do think that if the
- {@Location} were concerned about the {@Skill} consequences, we
- {@PersonType} think that theres a good reason why {@Organization}
- distinguished between disparate treatment and disparate
- {@Skill} {@Skill}
- But it's the langu{@Quantity} of Title VII itself, and in particular (h), which forbids action
- upon the results
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Why would {@Organization} have wanted to allow a question like this to be left open for
- such an extended period of time? Why would it not have wanted everybody who is potentially affected by it to
- understand where things stand at a much earlier point,
- at some reasonable period of time after all of the
- information is in the -- in the possession of a
- potential {@PersonType} to determine whether there has been
- a disparate {@Skill} and whether that -- that person is
- going to be adversely affected by it, particularly if at
- a later point the effect of a remedial decree can be to
- upset the {@Skill} -- the {@Skill} status of other
- people who have been hired in the interim? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: I agree that there -- there might be {@Skill} arguments against it as well as for it,
- but here's the way I think we look at it -- and the
- {@Location} {@Location} is the nation's largest {@PersonType}, and we
- face similar concerns
- We give certain {@Skill}s
- But I think what might have been -- what was probably animating {@Organization} was a fear that if the
- {@PersonType} rule of the City of {@Location} were adopted, then an
- {@PersonType} who made it  days without an {@Organization} charge
- being filed,  days after the announcement of the {@Skill}
- results, would then be able to for all time use that
- discriminatory {@Skill}, and it would lock in that period,
- that {@Skill}, for as long as ,  years, and {@Organization}
- could have legitimately worried about if a {@Skill} made it
- days, an {@PersonType} essentially had a get-out-of-jail-
- free {@Product}d to use for all time
- And I would say that that precise thing appears to have happened in this very
- {@Location}
- At Joint Appendix p{@Quantity} , when the City announced its {@Skill} results in {@DateTime} of ,
- it said it intended to use this {@Skill} for only
- years through
- Afterwards,  came, the City, in the City's own {@Product} -- this is the {@Location} of appeals
- brief at p{@Quantity}  -- they admit they made a new decision
- to continue using this {@Skill} and the {@Skill} results for
- subsequent {@Skill} rounds
- That was a new decision, and indeed that's a decision, I think, many {@PersonType} would
- logically make after  years, because then they
- don't have to worry about the possibility of a disparate
- {@Skill} {@Skill}{@Product}
- And since, as this {@Location} said in {@Person}, {@Quantity} of the goals of Title VII is really to encour{@Quantity}
- {@PersonType} voluntary {@Skill} on the part of {@PersonType}, adopting
- a rule like the City of {@Location}'s is really antithetical
- to that, because then it will essentially lock in for
- all time that old discriminatory {@Skill}
- I think another reason {@Skill} -- another {@Skill} reason {@Organization} {@DateTime} have thought about is that a
- rule that forced people to file within  days might be
- damaging to the {@Organization} and divisive to {@PersonType}, because
- it would say you only have that -day period to file,
- even before all the consequences of the -- of the -- of
- the {@Skill} decision are fully understood
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: Well, actually in -- in this {@Location}, am I correct that -- that  years has g{@Quantity} by,
- but that's because of the {@Skill}? The {@Product} was filed, what,  months after the -day period ran? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: The {@Quantity} charge was filed, I believe,  days after the {@DateTime} th announcement of
- the {@Skill} results
- And, yes, Justice {@Person}, then there was a period of {@Skill} and {@Skill} over business
- necessity and the like
- And in this {@Location}, the City admitted in other {@Skill} that there was no basis for giving this
- cutoff score, that a person who scored  was just as
- likely to succeed as a {@PersonType} as a person who
- was -- who had scored
- {@PersonType} Justice {@Person}, you had asked about the remedy in the {@Location}, and here's how we understand the way
- remedies work in disparate {@Skill} {@Skill}: It's largely injunctive in nature
- It's mostly about preventing future problems
- There is a back pay claim that is available that is statutorily capped at  years
- Not every{@Quantity} in this ,-person {@Event} could get that full amount of
- back pay obviously
- Instead, what happened here, there was a remedial phase at {@Event}, and what they did was they
- decided that -- the {@PersonType}s on both sides admitted that
- people, approximately, would have been hired out of
- that {@Event}, and that provided the appropriate amount of
- back pay
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: So you get --{@PersonType} KENNEDY: Was it -- was it  named people or was it just  undifferentiated? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: I think it was  undifferentiated people, and then I think there --
- and Mr
- {@Person} can, I think, fully explain how the
- randomization of awards was allocated
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: So everybody gets  over , times whatever the number of people who
- would have been hired? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Right
- And --
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: I mean the pay for the number of people
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Right
- And, Mr
- {@PersonType}, to respond to your concern before, that amount of m{@Quantity}y
- is not -- you couldn't go back and look to earlier
- periods of time outside of the statute of limitations,
- outside of the -day period, rather only any
- subsequent use
- For {@Event}ple, in this {@Location} the remedy couldn't look to the {@Quantity} round of {@Skill} because no
- {@Skill}{@Product} was brought within that {@Quantity} round of {@Skill}
- It was brought at the -- it was brought after the {@Quantity}
- round of {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: I think you had a footnote in your reply brief that said that if your
- position prevails there would need to be an adjustment
- in the relief granted by the {@Location} {@Location} --{@Organization}
- {@Location}: That is --{@PersonType} {@Person}: -- wasnt it? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That is correct
- And I think that the {@PersonType}s agree with that as well
- And that's I think a further limit on the way in which this
- present violation theory operates as a matter of
- {@Event}
- {@DateTime}, this {@Location} has said in {@Location}s such as {@Person} that -- that there must be a present
- violation, and disparate {@Skill} {@Skill} looks quite
- {@PersonType} different than disparate treatment {@Skill} in
- {@Event}, because disparate {@Skill} {@Skill} doesn't
- need that missing element that has been at issue in
- {@Person} and Evans and Ricks, of discriminatory intent
- at that subsequent time of action
- Here, in a disparate {@Skill} {@Location}, all that need be shown by the {@PersonType} is adverse {@Skill}, and
- that adverse {@Skill} happens in each of those  rounds
- of {@Skill}
- Each of the time -- each time the City used its {@Skill} results and drew a line and said, you under ,
- we are not looking at you, that was action upon the
- results, to use the langu{@Quantity} of (h)()
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: And that would be clear even though it had not been established much earlier
- that the {@Skill} was invalid
- So a {@Location} could go along using a {@Skill} that was an invalid {@Skill}, not declared
- such;  years later, somebody comes up and says: This {@Skill} that is being applied to me is an invalid {@Skill}
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: That's exactly correct, Justice {@Person}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: What -- of what use is a statute of limitations that -- that -- that operates
- that way? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Let me say {@Quantity} things: {@Quantity} is I think (h)() refers to "action upon the results,"
- {@PersonType} and that thing happened in  years is itself action
- upon the results, and so I think as a statutory matter
- the langu{@Quantity} decides it
- {@DateTime}, with respect to the {@Skill} reason, I think the reason is that otherwise {@Organization} had to fear
- precisely what youre saying, that an {@PersonType}
- years from {@DateTime} would use that discriminatory {@Skill},
- because they knew they had made it past the -day
- initial phase of time, and then could use it for all
- time
- And so the statute of limitations and the concerns about repose work hand in hand with other
- concerns of Title VII, and in particular incentivizing
- {@PersonType} to ensure voluntary {@Skill} with the {@Skill} of
- Title VII, and which this {@Location} said in {@Person}, the goal
- of which is to eradicate discrimination from the {@Location}
- {@Location}' labor markets
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: So I suppose the benefit is not that the City k{@DateTime}s it's safe -- it can
- rely on a {@Skill} and all that -- but k{@DateTime}s that it only has
- to pay  days back
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: That is -- that is -- that is the benefit of that particular back pay limitation, yes
- But in a {@Location} like this, where the City k{@DateTime}s very well,
- this {@Skill} is discriminatory and, indeed, has said so in
- {@Skill}, I think {@Organization} wanted to incentivize and
- {@PersonType} make sure there was an ability for people to sue at each time that discriminatory {@Skill} was used
- If there are no further questions
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Thank you, {@PersonType}
- Ms
- {@Person}
- ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNA RUTH {@Person} ON BEHALF OF THE {@PersonType} {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Thank you, Mr
- {@PersonType}, and {@DateTime} it please the {@Location}: In {@DateTime} , the City adopted and announced an eligibility list for {@Skill} {@PersonType} who
- sat for the {@PersonType}' {@Event}ination
- {@PersonType}s were told that a priority {@Location} had been created, that based
- on their scores they were not {@Event}ified in that {@Location},
- and that further consideration of {@PersonType} would be
- limited to those who were in the priority {@Location}, at least
- until every{@Quantity} in that {@Location} had been called for
- {@Skill}
- The City also publicly admitted that this tiered eligibility list had adverse {@Skill} on
- African-{@PersonType}s, and {@PersonType}s were aware of this
- But {@PersonType}s did not file charges challenging the
- {@Event} and the cutoff score within  days after the
- tiered eligibility list was adopted and announced
- {@DateTime} they contend that charges can be filed
- {@PersonType} to challenge the same {@Event} and the same cutoff score
- every time the City hired from the priority {@Skill} {@Location}
- That position cannot be squared with the statute
- Calling other {@PersonType}s from a {@Skill} {@Location} from which
- {@PersonType}s had already been excluded did not limit or
- {@Event}ify {@PersonType}s in any way
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Suppose there were no list, but each time there was a {@Skill} round the City
- just took from the top -- from the top score down
- Theres no list, but each time the City uses the {@Skill}
- results and hires the people with the top scores
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: If I understand correctly, that would be the same {@Location} as this, for this reason:
- A list is used in a couple of different ways
- A list might be used to describe the strict {@Skill} ordering that
- Your {@Skill} is describing, and in that {@Location}, once there
- is that kind of a list, it's the same as this {@Location}
- What happened in this {@Location} after that kind of a list was made, we also drew another line, which was
- the priority {@Skill} {@Location}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: No, my -- my hypothetical was theres no list at all
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: If --{@PersonType} {@Person}: They just go back to the raw scores, and each time they picked the top people
- {@PersonType} {@Organization}
- {@Person}: So that actually -- if were going back to the scores but no announcement has been
- made ever that we are going to use the scores in a
- certain way, we agree that every time the {@Location} actually
- consulted the scores, there would be a new claim
- But that's because --{@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, what is -- what is the list, other than an administratively convenient way
- to use the scores? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The list was the device that limited and {@Event}ified {@PersonType}s in this {@Location}, and
- that's why it's so important
- Because in order to have a present cause of action, section (a)() -- under
- section (a)(), which is the disparate {@Skill} provision,
- {@PersonType}s have to point to something in the {@Skill}
- period that actually limited and {@Event}ified them
- And that was the effect of the list, and including the
- priority {@Skill} {@Location}
- In a {@Location} where there is no {@Skill}, no announcement, no decision, nothing, but
- rather every time the City makes {@Skill}, the City
- undertakes a new decision with new criteria, then it is
- making a decision at that point; it is engaging in a
- {@Event} that is then at that time limiting and
- {@Event}ifying the {@PersonType}s
- What happened --
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: So even though there is a clear {@Location} on the merits of disparate {@Skill}, unless the
- {@Product} is commenced within  days of the announcement,
- then it's as though it were {@Skill}ful
- That's your position
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The statute, (a)(), requires an un{@Skill}ful --{@PersonType} {@Person}: Is that -- is that --there's a free pass
- You don't sue within  days of the {@Skill} of the list and the notice of the list; you sue
- days later
- The discriminatory {@Event} gets frozen, the status quo gets frozen forever
- That's -- that is your position, is it not? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That is the function of the operation of the statute of limitations, and of course
- it's not unique to Title VII
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: But this is not exactly a title -- a statute of limitations
- It's a time you have to file your charge
- It's a charge {@Skill}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Correct
- And --{@PersonType} {@Person}: Theres also a -year statute of limitations in Title VII
- You can't get back pay, I think, for more than  years
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The -day {@Skill} period under Title VII functions like a statute of limitations,
- {@PersonType} and when a timely charge is not filed, no recovery can
- be had for that claim
- And the {@Location} has said that over and over in a series of disparate treatment {@Location}s
- {@DateTime}, the defining feature --{@PersonType} {@Person}: You -- you don't have {@Quantity} {@Location}, I think, certainly not from this {@Location}, of
- disparate {@Skill}
- All the {@Location}s that you cite are disparate treatment {@Location}s
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The {@Location}s are disparate treatment {@Location}s, Justice {@Person}, but the rule should
- be the same in this {@Location} for several reasons: {@Quantity},
- those {@Location}s reflect that the reason there is not
- a present violation when the consequences of a prior
- discriminatory act are felt is because the defining
- feature of the claim is absent within the {@Skill}
- period
- {@DateTime}, that is a perfectly good rule, no matter whether it's discriminatory treatment or discriminatory
- {@Skill}
- And in this {@Location}, the defining feature, namely disparate {@Skill} in the sense defined by the statute,
- required by the statute, to limit or {@Event}ify in a way
- that denies people {@Skill} opportunities based on
- {@Event} -- that defining feature was absent within the
- {@Skill} period
- {@PersonType} BREYER: How is it absent? Because
- {@PersonType} the statute says that the established -- the -- it's
- established -- namely, the un{@Skill}ful {@Skill} {@Event}
- -- it's established only if, and certainly if, the
- {@PersonType} uses --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: Right
- {@PersonType} BREYER: -- a particular {@Skill} {@Event} that has a disparate {@Skill}
- That refers back to (a)()
- So back in that period, on a certain date, he used that limiting {@Event}, and, therefore, on that
- particular date, he established the un{@Skill}ful {@Skill}
- {@Event} by using a {@Skill} that limited, et cetera
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I -- I have {@Quantity} responses, Justice {@Person}, and the {@Quantity} is that section (k), which
- is what Your {@Skill} is quoting from, does not describe
- accrual, and it does not define the underlying violation
- It talks about when an -- excuse me, when a violation is
- established
- And what's so interesting is that the reliance on those words "uses an {@Skill} {@Event}" --
- its a few words plucked out of the middle of section (k)
- You actually can't apply section (k) literally to this {@Location} and have anything that approaches
- anything that makes sense
- And that's because section (k) actually goes on after those words that get highlighted over and over, and its -- and it refers to
- {@PersonType} the rest of what happens in a {@Location} when a claim of disparate {@Skill} is tried
- And so if you --{@PersonType} {@PersonType}: So why don't we look at subsection (h) --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: Subsection --{@PersonType} {@PersonType}: -- that says -- and it's an -- "it shall be an un{@Skill}ful {@Skill} {@Event} for
- an {@PersonType} to give and" -- conjunctive -- "and act
- upon the results
- " {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Correct
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: So when you hire, aren't you acting upon the results? And how are you acting upon -- you {@DateTime} be acting upon it, as {@PersonType} argues,
- when you {@Event}ify, but why aren't you acting upon when
- you hire? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Because there is no act that limits and {@Event}ifies
- And whats interesting about section (h), it's not --{@PersonType} {@PersonType}: I -- I go back to Justice {@Person}'s point
- Isn't it, in the very act of {@Skill}, you are using the {@Skill} results and saying --
- each time you do it, youre saying: I'm going to cut off at this limit, and I'm not going to consider some{@Quantity}
- outside of this limited tier
- {@PersonType} {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, that's what is actually missing in this {@Location}
- The {@Location} did not go back to the {@Skill} results, and it did not -- it did not create --
- eng{@Quantity} in a new decision or a new {@Event}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: But isn't that what "{@Event} and {@Skill}" means? Meaning that each time, as you continue {@PersonType}, you are using a particular
- {@Event}, a particular {@Skill}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@PersonType}s continued to be ineligible for as long as the list was used in the way
- that we said at the outset it was going to be used;
- namely, that the well-{@PersonType} {@Location}, the priority
- {@Skill} {@Location}, would be called {@Quantity}
- The reason they continued to be ineligible is because they had been limited and {@Event}ified as
- ineligible until the priority {@Location} was hired {@Quantity}
- That was the only {@Event} that had adverse {@Skill}
- within -- as required by the statute, meaning limit and
- {@Event}ify
- {@DateTime}, to complete my answer to Justice {@Person} --{@PersonType} STEVENS: May I ask this question, Ms
- {@Person}? Would your argument be the same if the {@Event} in this {@Location} were -- required a {@Location}
- diploma?
- {@PersonType} Did you understand my question? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I'm sorry
- I didn't realize you had finished
- Excuse me
- {@PersonType} STEVENS: Suppose the {@Event} were a {@Location} diploma
- Could that -- would you make the same argument as you're making {@DateTime}? {@PersonType} {@Person}: And let's add to that, that it was adopted  years ago --{@PersonType} STEVENS: Thats right
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: -- and Duke Power announced to the world that it was going to use a high
- {@Location} diploma
- Indeed, it listed in the county all of the {@Location} {@PersonType} and said: This is the list
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: A {@Location} like that might present different accrual problems for this reason: There might be several appropriate times when a person affected by a
- {@Skill} like that could be said actually to have been
- limited and {@Event}ified in their {@Skill}
- opportunities
- And it could be when they enter {@Location}, but that is not an appropriate time, so if it's
- years before the act -- so that person is -- is
- roughly  {@Quantity}
- It could be when they apply to the {@PersonType}
- It could be a variety of other times
- But those {@Location}s, whatever difficult accrual problems and questions they
- {@PersonType} present, they are not presented here, because this was a
- closed universe
- Everybody affected by the City's eligibility list and the {@Skill} and the cutoff score knew
- from the moment --{@PersonType} STEVENS: No, but -- but in my {@Event}ple, everybody who is not a {@Location} graduate
- would have been affected right away
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: But if they are not interested in {@Skill} with that {@PersonType}, then they are not --
- it -- you -- they are certainly affected in {@Quantity} sense of
- the word, but theyre perhaps -- it would not be possible
- to say their {@Skill} opportunities had been affected
- We certainly agree that there should be {@Quantity} time to challenge every {@Skill} {@Event} that has an
- un{@Skill}ful disparate {@Skill}, but the question in this {@Location}
- is whether there is more than {@Quantity} to challenge exactly
- the same thing? {@PersonType}s --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: You force people to challenge the {@Event} when they don't even k{@DateTime} if it's
- going to affect them
- In the hypothetical that has been discussed, somebody who didn't graduate from high
- {@Location}, you k{@DateTime}, wants to be something other than a
- {@PersonType}
- But that doesn't work out, and then he says, well, {@DateTime} I want to be a {@PersonType}
- And they say, well, you can't, because you didn't graduate from high
- {@PersonType} {@Location}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Right
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: And I think your position is that, well, he should have filed that
- {@Product} earlier, no? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Our position is that the {@Skill} period runs from the un{@Skill}ful {@Event}
- And the {@Location} has stressed it is important to confirm --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, but what is the un{@Skill}ful {@Event}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The un{@Skill}ful {@Event} here was limiting and {@Event}ifying {@PersonType}s in a way that
- deprived them of their {@Skill} opportunities
- This is what -- this -- what they were told --{@PersonType} {@Person}: Can we put that in concrete terms? It was the  {@Quantity} cutoff, so that anybody who got below  {@Quantity} on the {@Skill} was never
- going to be considered until all the {@Quantity} people who
- got  to
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Correct
- And after that decision was made, there was nothing else that {@Location}
- did that affected {@PersonType}s in the terms required by
- the statute
- Hiring others did not adversely affect {@PersonType}s because they were --{@PersonType} {@PersonType}: So could you answer
- {@PersonType} Justice {@Person}'s hypothetical? What is the difference between those people and each person who does not have a
- {@Location} diploma is not -- and is not hired? Does that mean that the moment that they announce the high
- {@Location} diploma requirement, that everybody who had
- already received {@Quantity}, whether they wanted to work at
- this job or not, had to sue, and it's only those people
- who just received the {@Location} diploma who can sue
- years later? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The statute requires that the --the complainant be limited and {@Event}ified in their
- {@Skill} opportunity
- So --{@PersonType} {@PersonType}: So what is the difference between the {@Skill} announcement that each
- time I hire, I'm not going to use a {@Location} -- I'm
- not going to look at people who don't have a {@Location}
- diploma, and I'm not going to look at people who don't
- have a {@Skill} score above
- What's the difference between those? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The difference is that once {@PersonType}s here were {@Event}ified out of the eligible
- {@Location} for priority {@Skill}, they were out
- They were simply out
- They were not being considered anymore at all
- We didn't go back to look at the {@Skill}
- We didn't consider {@PersonType}s
- We didn't reject them each time
- {@PersonType} There could be --{@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, somebody getting --some{@Quantity} getting a letter that you sent to people who
- were {@PersonType} didn't k{@DateTime} that
- The only thing that I see that you sent to the people who fell into the
- {@PersonType} category was that it was unlikely, which I take
- it means less than  {@Quantity}, that they would be called
- for further {@Skill}, but it was possible that they
- would be called for further {@Skill}
- You didn't tell them anything about -- you didn't tell them that you were
- going to fill all of your available positions with
- people who were {@Event}ified as well {@PersonType} in that
- letter --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: With respect --{@PersonType} {@Person}: -- did you? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: With respect, Justice {@Person}, the letter does say that because of the large number of
- people who were {@Event}ified well-{@PersonType}, a step a{@PersonType}
- of where {@PersonType}s were {@Event}ified, it was not likely
- that they were going to be hired
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Right
- That's right
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: And for that reason, that is when the injury and the {@Skill} was felt
- Whatever else later happened, whether {@Location} hired a lot of people,
- {@Location} hired no {@Quantity}, whether {@Location} even hired some of
- {@PersonType} the {@PersonType}s, they had years' worth of delay
- And at this point in the {@Skill}, it is undisputed
- The City made  hires from the {@Quantity} use of the list
- That's more than any other {@Event} --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Just to follow up on Justice {@Person}'s question, what if it were different?
- What if the letter said, look, you didn't get, youre
- not well {@PersonType}, but we really do expect to hire a lot
- more, so, you k{@DateTime}, keep your fingers crossed
- Theres a good chance that you are going to be hired
- And you say those people should have sued right then? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Correct
- Because the {@Skill}, at a minimum, is the delay in {@Skill}
- And the {@Location} has made quite clear that you don't -- a complainant or
- {@PersonType} does not have to feel all of the consequences
- right at the outset to --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, that's kind of a bad {@Skill}, isn't it? Youre telling people who {@DateTime} probably not be injured at all -- you are saying, well,
- you still have to go into Federal {@Location} and sue
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: With respect, {@PersonType} {@Person}, they are injured
- Their {@Skill} will be delayed, possibly substantially
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Oh, sure
- No, I
- {@PersonType} understand that, but, you k{@DateTime}, let's say we
- think we are going to hire -- if the {@Skill} goes
- through, we think were going to hire everybody else
- by -- in  months
- And youre saying, well, those people have to sue anyway because they are injured by
- the -month delay
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: They are injured by a -month delay
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Yes
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: But there {@DateTime} be circumstances in which information is not conveyed in a way that would
- put a reasonable person on notice that he or she had a
- claim right at the outset, and that relates also to the
- {@Location} diploma hypothetical
- If the --{@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, why did the City say that it was planning to give a new {@Skill} in
- years and then wait {@DateTime} before giving a
- new {@Skill}? If I received {@Quantity} of these {@PersonType} letters, and I also -- and I knew in addition that the City was
- going to give a {@Skill} in  years, that might well
- affect my incentive about bringing a {@Skill}{@Product} to
- challenge this
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: But it wouldn't change the fact that there had been, at least a -- if you wait for
- the next list, you still have been delayed at least
- {@PersonType} years in your ability to be hired as a {@PersonType}
- And as far as the reason why we didn't follow through on the
- aspirational goal of giving another {@Skill} within  years,
- the {@Skill}s are very difficult and expensive to deliver,
- I think -- to develop, excuse me
- The record in this {@Location} actually makes that clear
- Despite rather significant steps, including the use of a prominent African-{@PersonType} indus{@Event}
- {@PersonType} to develop this {@Skill}, it had severe adverse
- {@Skill}
- The {@Skill} actually compares rather favorably to the {@Skill} that was given in the City of {@Location}, but
- the {@Location} {@Location} invalidated it, and, you k{@DateTime}, we did
- undertake to develop a new {@Skill}
- But --{@PersonType} {@Person}: But you don't challenge that
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: -- surely the {@Location} --{@PersonType} {@Person}: You don't challenge that
- You {@DateTime} ack{@DateTime}ledge that the Plaintiffs were treated
- un{@Skill}fully
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: We have not pressed that claim
- That is correct, Justice {@Person}, but --{@PersonType} {@Person}: And were you prejudiced by the delay in the {@Skill} of the {@Organization} charge? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: There was some {@Skill}imony -- and we quote it in our brief -- about things that the person
- {@PersonType} responsible for setting the cutoff score could not
- remember
- But a statute of limitations actually doesn't require prejudice, so we didn't undertake to try to
- prove that
- The -- repose arises naturally at the end of the {@Skill} period
- It's not something that -- that the {@PersonType} has to earn either by capitulating to the
- {@PersonType}' demands or otherwise proving prejudice
- And in a {@Location} like this, it -- it wasn't possible simply to take the list down
- The {@Location}'s opinion in {@Person} makes that quite clear
- Our {@PersonType} told us all the way through the {@Event} -- he {@Skill}ified
- at the {@Event} --{@PersonType} {@Person}: You didn't have to take the list down
- You simply could have said: Any{@Quantity} who got a passing score, any{@Quantity} who is {@PersonType} -- were not
- going to make the distinction between {@PersonType} and
- un{@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I -- I believe --{@PersonType} {@Person}: You didn't have to throw out the list
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I believe --{@PersonType} {@Person}: You didn't have to throw out the {@Skill}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I believe the {@Location}'s opinion in {@Person} addresses that as well
- That that's a -- a
- {@PersonType} misuse of the {@Skill} scores
- The {@PersonType} was resolute even through the {@Event} --{@PersonType} {@Person}: I thought the {@PersonType} said -- the {@Skill} devisor said he didn't make up that
- {@Quantity} cutoff
- That was {@Location} that made that --that decision
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: He -- his reason for suggesting the  cutoff score was because of the
- adverse {@Skill}
- That was an attempt to deal with adverse {@Skill}, but his position was the {@Skill} was valid
- to measure the {@Skill} aspects that it was attempting
- to measure, and that those related to the {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} had to undergo in the academy
- And he was clear as well, that a higher score created an inference that the person was more
- {@PersonType} to -- to perform in the way --{@PersonType} {@Person}: But you -- you've lost --you've lost on that
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: We have
- But the reason that Im mentioning it is because it's not simply a matter
- of -- of why don't you take the list down
- At the time that the {@PersonType} is telling us the {@Skill} is valid and it
- can -- it gives rise to an inference that people closer
- to the top are better -- possess more of the {@Skill}
- abilities that the {@Skill} was {@Skill}ing for, we would have
- {@PersonType} at a minimum been {@Location}ing disparate treatment liability
- to adjust the scores, to randomize them further, or to
- take the list down
- But to return --{@PersonType} {@Person}: No, but -- but going to , opening up the {@Event}ification, is not adjusting the
- scores; it's not taking the list down; it's just saying
- any{@Quantity} who passes the {@Skill} can proceed to the next step
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: It seriously diminished the opportunities of the people who were at  and above
- There were about , {@PersonType}s at  or above, and
- there were ,  or above
- So calling in random order --{@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: You've got to -- I mean, youve just got to take your -- get as good
- {@Skill} as you can and determine is it -- are we
- going to be in more trouble if we follow the {@Skill} or
- more trouble if we -- if we take it down? People have to do that all the time
- They look -- well, if I do this, I'm going to be in trouble;
- if I do this, I'm going to -- but I have got to decide
- what I should do
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Correct, but read in conjunction with the -day {@Skill} period
- And I would like to follow up just briefly on answers to
- Justice {@Person} and Justice {@Person}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, I'm sorry
- Read in conjunction with the  -- you have got to
- finish that sentence at least, before --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: I -- I'm sorry
- That was the -- so, yes, at the point where the {@PersonType} is
- assessing the options, the City was not sued within --
- excuse me, charges were not filed within  days after
- the tiered eligibility list was adopted and announced
- {@PersonType}s were aware that it had adverse {@Skill}
- No charges were filed then; no charges were filed after the
- {@Quantity} use of the list
- So at some point when the {@PersonType} is weighing the options, the {@PersonType} can also factor in
- the time to challenge this has passed
- What {@PersonType}s seek here is new opportunities --  --  opportunities to challenge
- exactly the same thing that they -- that they would have
- challenged if they had filed a charge promptly
- They continue to emphasize that the eligibility {@Location}, when
- compared with the {@Location} of {@PersonType}s, had a disparate
- {@Skill}
- But that's not a new violation
- That's not a new {@Event}ification, and it doesn't limit anybody's
- opportunities in any way beyond what they were already
- limited
- That's the old violation
- That's the {@Quantity} they didn't charge
- {@PersonType} {@DateTime}, {@PersonType}s do claim that the shortfall evidence showed that they -- showed and the use of the
- list had disparate {@Skill} each time
- But it actually didn't, either
- That also was the old violation
- That shortfall was compiled by comparing the number of
- African-{@PersonType}s who were hired using the  cutoff
- score and the number who would have been called for
- further {@Skill} if --{@PersonType} {@Person}: How do you -- the problem I have with all of this -- it makes entire sense, except
- when you read subpart (k), it says an un{@Skill}ful
- {@Skill} {@Event} based on disparate {@Skill} is
- established if a complaining party demonstrates that a
- {@PersonType} uses a particular {@Skill} {@Event} that
- causes a disparate {@Skill} on the basis of {@Event}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Correct
- But you have --{@PersonType} {@Person}: Which is what happened here
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: But the fact --{@PersonType} {@Person}: They used --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: Excuse me, Justice {@Person}
- The statute goes on, and it describes the later things
- that happened at {@Event}
- So in our view, read literally --{@PersonType} {@Person}: Where -- where does it go
- {@PersonType} on? To say what? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: It goes on to say that the {@PersonType} fails to demonstrate that the challenged
- process is job-related, or subpart (ii), there is
- an alternative {@Event} with less disparate {@Skill}
- So -- so (k), if (k) is going to be consulted at all, and
- we do not think that it should be, because section
- (e), which has always been thought of as the {@Skill}
- period, talks about an alleged un{@Skill}ful {@Event}, and
- that's what the person k{@DateTime}s at the outset
- Section (k) talks about the burden of proof and how you go about proving these at {@Event}, and that's
- why it uses the word "established
- " But that's also why it describes the entirety of what happens at {@Event}
- Read literally, you can pluck a few words out of the --
- out of {@Quantity} of these provisions and say, aha, they used
- an {@Skill} {@Event}
- You have to read the whole thing together if youre going to read it at all, and
- when you read the whole thing together, you come up with
- the absurd result that the {@Skill} period doesn't run
- until the {@Location} {@Location} brings the gavel down and
- determines that an un{@Skill}ful {@Event} has been
- established
- In this {@Location}, that would have meant that the people  and below could file charges within  days
- {@PersonType} after the {@Location} {@Location}'s decision, which is something
- like  years after the {@Event} in this {@Location}
- And that's because that was the moment at which it was
- established
- And that's why we think that (k) does not bear on this
- And (h) --{@PersonType} BREYER: Is my impression -- is there anything else in that (k)? You see, it lists about  things, let's say  -- imagine
- {@Quantity} of those things is that it was used
- {@DateTime}, all the other things there will not have been -- are things that --
- that -- to do with the {@Skill}, basically
- So you have like {@Quantity} or seven that have to do with the {@Skill} and the
- criteria, and then you have {@Quantity} that it was used
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Right, and that's why --{@PersonType} BREYER: And -- and so I thought, looking at the list, it's quite right that it's used for
- a different purpose but --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: It's not --{@PersonType} BREYER: But, I mean, this (k) has to do with a different thing, but -- but -- and the
- critical element of it was that the {@Event} be used
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: You -- but again, even if (k) is consulted -- and for the reasons that I just outlined
- we don't think that it should be
- It doesn't bear on accrual
- But even if (k) is consulted, it doesn't --
- {@PersonType} it doesn't say that any use of an {@Skill} {@Event} is
- -- is a new un{@Skill}ful act
- It has to be an {@Skill} {@Event} that actually has disparate {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} BREYER: Well, you'd have to then say that all the things that are there, the other {@Quantity}
- and so forth -- all those {@Quantity} things --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: This is actually --{@PersonType} BREYER: Well --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: Excuse me, Justice {@Person}
- This is actually a slightly different point
- At the outset, I indicated why section (k) does not bear on
- accrual at all; it describes what happens at {@Event}, and
- for that reason --{@PersonType} BREYER: Yes
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: -- you really can't pluck a few words out of the middle
- {@PersonType} BREYER: No, well, that's true --it does --{@Organization}
- {@Person}: But even if {@Quantity} is going to consult it to determine accrual, what it says is that
- the use of an {@Skill} {@Event} with adverse {@Skill}
- And in this {@Location} there was only {@Quantity}, and that {@Quantity} was
- when {@PersonType}s were limited and {@Event}ified based on
- the {@Skill} scores
- Nothing that happened after that, including {@Skill} others, was an un{@Skill}ful {@Event} with
- {@PersonType} disparate {@Skill} in a way that affected the {@PersonType}s
- They had already been rejected
- When an {@PersonType} says, I will not consider you for the position, or perhaps it says, I will not
- consider you for the position until I have considered a
- lot of other people {@Quantity}, that is a rejection
- Nothing that happens after that, whether the person hires
- somebody else, whether the person doesn't hire somebody
- else, whether they change their mind and later hire the
- person whom they had {@DateTime} rejected -- Ricks, after
- all had a grievance pending
- It was certainly possible that that would change the outcome in the {@Location}, but the
- {@Location}, n{@Quantity}theless, says you cannot wait for the
- consequences to be felt
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: That was a disparate treatment {@Location}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Correct, but there is no --{@PersonType} {@Person}: And the -- the argument here is disparate {@Skill} is different because theres
- no need to show intent of disparate {@Skill}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Correct
- But the only {@Event} in this {@Location} that had a disparate {@Skill} in the
- sense used by the statute was when the tiered
- eligibility list was made
- After that, of course there was a consequence of that
- Consequences can be felt in
- {@PersonType} {@Skill} for a long time
- The people in the well-{@PersonType} {@Location} were hired before {@PersonType}s, they
- were paid before {@PersonType}s, they are going to get
- their pensions before {@PersonType}s
- Those things continue to have consequences
- But the {@Location} has made clear that the consequences cannot be challenged by themselves unless
- there actually is a present violation
- {@DateTime}, there is not even an argument in the other side's {@Product}, neither of them, that explains why
- there was an adverse {@Skill} based on {@Event} under (a)()
- at any point when the City used the list
- If {@Quantity} reads the {@Product} very {@Product}efully, {@Quantity} will see that those times
- when a claim is made in the {@Product} that we used an
- un{@Skill}ful {@Event}, it always goes back to the {@Skill} and
- the list
- Simply keeping the list up after we announce it is not a new violation
- It is quite clear in the {@Location}s that the {@PersonType} does not have to change a
- decision in order to obtain repose
- And, of course, the disparate treatment and disparate {@Skill} are simply different methods of proving
- a claim
- They are not different claims by themselves
- In this {@Location}, in addition to the statutory langu{@Quantity},
- there are a number of {@Skill} reasons that while we don't
- {@PersonType} rely on them heavily, we do rely on the statute
- They should n{@Quantity}theless be considered in deciding this
- There was no sense in which a claim filed to challenge
- the list was premature
- It was the {@Quantity} act that actually limited and {@Event}ified {@PersonType}s
- Everything else that happened after that either didn't affect the {@PersonType}s at all, as in
- {@Skill} people who had made the cut, or it affected them
- only in the colloquial sense, that the consequences of
- the prior act continued
- {@Location} did not have to revisit this in order to obtain repose
- The statute makes that quite clear
- Mr
- {@Person} emphasizes only the {@Skill} of righting {@Skill} wrongs, but there are other policies
- in the statute
- In addition to repose, the statute makes clear that claims should be brought to the {@Organization} at
- the earliest opportunity
- Excuse me
- We ask that the judgment be affirmed
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Thank you, {@PersonType}
- Mr
- {@Person}, you have  minutes remaining
- REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF {@Person}
- {@Person} ON BEHALF OF THE {@PersonType} {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Thank you
- {@Person}
- {@Quantity} is that there was no formula before
- There was some general guidance that was given in the
- statute
- It's much like the proposition of good faith
- {@Skill} is almost incapable of definition, yet every
- circuit in the {@Location} {@Location} has a laundry list of
- factors that are taken into account for good faith
- Here, reasonable and necessary expenses under the old {@Skill} had a few suggestions as to what
- needed to be involved with them
- {@DateTime} we have a portion of another part of the triangle, which is under (b)
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: But in a sense that cuts against you
- As I was -- when I was reading your opening brief, it seemed to me the t{@Quantity} was, well, if
- you accept the {@PersonType}'s position {@Organization} did
- nothing at all
- Well, they did do something very important
- They had a formula for disposable income
- The question is, does that formula apply to {@Skill}ed?
- Can that formula be modified altered or {@Skill}ed for
- {@Skill}ed? So it's not as if {@Organization} did nothing or it's not as if the amendment accomplishes nothing even
- under the {@PersonType}'s view
- It accomplished something very important
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: My answer, Justice {@Person}, is that the definition of the word, quote, "{@Skill}ed,"
- end of quote, has -- there's never has been {@Quantity} in the
- {@Skill}
- That was a term that was in the  {@Skill} and is {@Product}ried over into the present {@Skill}
- How it was applied is vastly different
- The dispute under the prior {@Skill} was over whether or not the
- {@Location} could take into account changes in circumstances
- which were likely to occur post{@Skill}
- And so we had {@Location}s like the {@Person} v
- {@Person} {@Location} out of the
- Ninth {@Location} and the Midkiff {@Location} out of the Tenth
- {@Location} that disagreed as to how that ought to be
- applied
- In the {@Person} v
- {@Person} {@Location} the Chapter  {@PersonType} requested that the {@PersonType} sign
- essentially a pledge that they would devote their excess
- income to the plan, and the {@Person} {@Location} said: Wait a minute; there is another statute at issue here and that
- allows for the modification of the plan after the plan has been confirmed
- Prior to the {@Skill} of the plan, the {@PersonType} still has the
- ability -- and this ties in with some of the comments
- made by Justice {@Person} -- the {@PersonType} still has the
- ability to amend the plan under
- So all of these statutes need to be read together to show what the result is
- {@DateTime} the question is not whether or not changes should be taken into
- account for post{@Skill} that {@DateTime} be likely to
- occur, but whether or not the {@Location} {@DateTime} deviate from the
- statute where {@Organization} has said this is how we want you
- to determine current {@DateTime} income, therefore
- disposable income and consequently {@Skill}ed disposable
- income
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: But you already told us that there could be a deviation through this
- (A)(ii)
- And why, if that was all that needed to be d{@Quantity}, did the {@PersonType} recommend, did the {@PersonType} say,
- {@Location}ruptcy {@PersonType}, let's move the period, let's use this
- provision and we will get another period that doesn't
- have those  months with the extraordinary income? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: No, Justice {@Person}, and the reason is, is that that privilege is accorded only to
- the {@PersonType} to move that -month period
- Neither the unsecured {@PersonType}s nor the {@PersonType} have the ability to
- request that that -month period be moved
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, it could have been suggested to the {@PersonType}: You can accomplish what you want by using this provision
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: The record is silent as to whether or not that occurred
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: What -- where can you move it? I don't really -- this is the same line of inquiry as Justice {@Person}
- What's the -- what has to be the
- much beyond the date of what, the {@Event}? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: It would be up to {@Skill}, but the {@Skill} {@Event} could be
- continued as the {@Location} saw fit
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: The review of the determination or the request to move the period is -- is
- what? Up to the total discretion of the -- of the {@PersonType}? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: It appears to be so under the statute, {@PersonType} {@Person}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: So your objection to the fact that the {@PersonType} has more discretion with respect
- to defining "{@Skill}ed disposable" -- you don't mind the
- discretion on the other side
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: No, Your {@Skill}, I don't believe the discretion is not in {@Skill} the income,
- only in {@Skill} the time period
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Right, but the only purpose of moving the time period is to change the
- income
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: That's true
- And there are other options that the {@PersonType} had available in addition
- to that, that we have referred to as the {@Quantity} options,
- which would be the {@PersonType} could have here just delayed
- {@Skill} the {@Location} for a couple of months and these
- problems would not have occurred
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: There is another discretion that you don't seem to object to
- {@Quantity} way the {@PersonType} can get out of the bind that he's put
- in by the fixing of the confirmed plan is simply to move
- for a revision of the confirmed plan
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Absolutely, Justice {@Person}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: What constrains the {@PersonType} in allowing or not allowing the revision? Doesn't he have the same kind of discretion with regard to the
- revision that you're objecting to with regard to his
- establishing the {@Skill}s? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Justice {@Person}, I don't think so
- has been subject to quite a {@Quantity} of {@Skill}, but the argument that we make in our reply brief is that
- it would be simply necessary to plug in and plug out
- whatever the change in circumstance is
- So the {@PersonType} would be able to say, my wife's income is {@DateTime} g{@Quantity}, so we want to take that out
- of the formula
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: But that's the same thing that's being argued here, that -- that you start with
- the fixed {@Skill} based on the  months before and
- then you have to show that there were some extraordinary
- circumstances that justify a change
- I don't see that there's any difference
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: There {@DateTime} not be, except that there is a statutory requirement as to how that is
- accomplished and that's where the (A)(ii) comes
- into play
- It's not so much that there is a problem {@PersonType} {@Person}: What your {@Location} comes down to is the {@Location}ruptcy {@Location} can do this, but it has to do
- it by simply revising the plan, not by establishing the
- plan initially but by revising it
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Not necessarily, Your {@Skill}
- That certainly is {@Quantity} way
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Maybe? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: It {@DateTime} be, yes
- It depends on the facts of the {@Location}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, that's a good answer, isn't it, because your point would be the
- statute does not allow that exercise of discretion with
- respect to {@Skill}ed disposable income, but it does in
- the other areas
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Well, again I respectfully disagree, {@PersonType} {@Person}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: That was a {@PersonType}ly question
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: I'm sorry? I'm sorry, I didn't hear
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: No, my -- my point and what I thought your point would be is that the fact
- that there is exercise of discretion in {@Quantity} different
- areas is not the problem
- The problem is that in {@Quantity} area the discretion is specifically permitted and in the
- other area, {@Skill}ed disposable income, it's not
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: I agree
- (Laughter
- ) {@PersonType} {@Person}: But can the -- can the plan be modified based on -- can the plan be modified based
- on something that was k{@DateTime}n before the plan was
- confirmed? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: That depends on which jurisdiction {@Quantity} would be in, Justice {@Person}
- The most {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, if it can't, then how is this modification remedy going to work? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: I think it should be
- For {@Event}ple, a good {@Event}ple of this would be {@PersonType} is
- expected  years from {@DateTime} to no longer have to repay a
- (k) loan
- And so {@Quantity} view would be that you ought to take that into account as of that date and figure those
- {@Skill}, which becomes extremely unwieldy
- You are
- guessing at that point
- The {@PersonType} {@DateTime} say: Well, I {@DateTime} be losing that, but I don't k{@DateTime} what my actual
- circumstances are going to be  years from {@DateTime}
- Chapter  is a fluid process
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Your argument is that the {@Location} has to confirm a plan that is really not
- confirmable because the {@PersonType} can't possibly make the
- {@Skill}s under the plan, but then can turn around
- immediately and modify the plan so that it does call for
- {@Skill}s to be made
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: No, Your {@Skill}
- That is not my argument
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: explain it, then? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Well, what we are saying is that this plan cannot be confirmed as it stands because
- the {@PersonType} would have to be able to make those {@Skill}s
- and the {@PersonType} obviously is not capable of making those
- {@Skill}s
- But it's because she chose the wrong options
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: But let me just stop you there, because then the answer you gave to the Chief and
- to Justice {@Person} doesn't fit
- the {@Location}ruptcy {@PersonType} is not going to confirm the plan
- was she has to pay over $, a month, because she
- could never do that
- So you are not going to get that confirmed plan which could be amended later
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Well, I agreed with that
- I {@DateTime} have misunderstood the question that I was asked
- But what I'm saying is that the statute needs to be
- followed and if the {@PersonType} had followed the statutes
- here then the {@PersonType} likely could have obtained a
- confirmed plan by moving that -month time {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, what in addition to -- you brought up the  solution that she doesn't do
- what the statute tells her to do, so she's able to move
- it if the {@PersonType} agrees
- And you said she has other options
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Yes
- Well, the other options -- and I referred to them as the {@Quantity} options and the
- (A)(ii) is {@Quantity} of those options
- As I said, she could have delayed {@Skill} the {@Location}
- There is nothing in the schedules that would indicate that she was {@Skill}
- this {@Location}ruptcy under exigent circumstances
- There is no {@Skill}, there is no repossession, there's no
- garnishment, there's no {@Skill}{@Product}
- So delay would have been a possible, and a {@PersonType} is always able to
- determine the date of the {@Skill} of the {@Skill}
- The {@Quantity} thing that she could have d{@Quantity} is file a Chapter , and this is the anomaly between
- Chapter  and Chapter , is that she would have
- {@PersonType} in all likelihood for a discharge under
- Chapter  because she would have met the special
- circumstances {@Skill} in (b)
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: But then the {@PersonType}s would have been a lot worse off, would they not have
- been? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: That's very possible, but it's a formula that {@Organization} thought to place into
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, why would -- why would the {@PersonType} be urging the possibility that it
- would be okay for her to file under Chapter , in which
- {@Location} the unsecured {@PersonType}s would get very little, but
- it's not okay for her to use chapter  with a plan that
- would give the unsecured {@PersonType}s substantial {@Skill}s? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Here, Justice {@Person}, the reason is plain and simple, and that was I sought to
- enforce the rule of {@Skill} in order to have the {@Location}
- determine how the rules were supposed to be interpreted
- By my view, it seemed like that had she followed the
- rules {@DateTime}be she would have gotten there, but the way she
- did it she can't
- It's kind of like driving a {@Product}
- You can't expect that a the {@Product} is going to perform well if
- you don't turn the {@Product} on
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: {@Organization}
- {@Location}: And here she didn't turn the {@Product} on
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Can I come back to Justice {@Person}'s question about whether there would
- ever be the opportunity to adjust the confirmed plan?
- Because as you say, the plan here would not have been
- confirmed, but that -- that isn't the {@Location} always
- I mean, in many {@Location}s a plan would be confirmed because
- the -- the {@Location}rupt could -- could barely make the
- {@Skill}s that it requires; and then when it -- it is
- clear that, because of the extraordinary event in the
- preceding  months, the {@Location}rupt is -- is not going to
- have that -- that amount of m{@Quantity}y, there would be the
- opportunity to adjust
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Maybe not -- I'm sorry
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: In other words, is your response to Justice {@Person} "always," that it will
- always be the {@Location} that where there would be an
- adjustment under this theory, there would not have been
- a {@Skill} in the {@Quantity} place? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: If the plan is not confirmable by an analysis of Schedules I and J, which
- are the income and expenses statutes, I am not going to
- recommend {@Skill}, and nor do I think any {@PersonType}
- would
- Any events that are in the equation before the date of {@Skill} would likely be then subject to
- , the res judicata provisions of chapter
- So if the plan is confirmed, say in {@Person}'s {@Location},
- with these facts k{@DateTime}n, then she would not be able to
- come in afterwards and ask for the {@Location} to modify under
- because that's part of the {@Skill} order
- The other options that were available -- we discussed briefly the ability to file this as a Chapter
- She also could have converted this {@Location} to a Chapter  post-{@Skill} with the same result, or she could have
- dismissed this {@Location} and refiled
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Isn't that -- wouldn't that amount to just a -- a waste of everybody's time, to
- dismiss it and then refile it, and then she gets a time
- period that doesn't -- why -- why not just drop out
- those  months that are not representative of her
- income? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Because, Justice {@Person}, the statute does not permit that
- It's not within the formula, and that's the question: Is the formula {@Skill} or is it not {@Skill}? If it is {@Skill} then this -- obviously
- {@Organization} intended a more rule-bound statute
- It got that
- It was obvious that it intended to reduce judicial discretion, and the statute seems to
- accomplish that
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: But the thing is -- but you have explained, your number {@Quantity} solution for her is
- this  route, which is -- gives lots of discretion in
- the {@Location}
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Only in moving the -month period, Justice {@Person}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Yes
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: That would be the only discretion that the statute would appear to accord to
- the {@Location}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Where is that, by the way, the provision that allows it to move the
- -month period? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: It's in (A) and it provides that the term "current {@DateTime} income" means
- the aver{@Quantity} {@DateTime} income from all sources that the
- {@PersonType} receives, or in a joint {@Location} the {@PersonType} and the
- {@PersonType}'s spouse receive, without regard to whether such
- income is {@Skill}able income derived during the -month
- period ending on -- and then we come to subsections (i),
- little (i) -- or (ii)
- And those are -- that's the disjuncture; it's the -month period prior or some other
- time {@Skill}, and the langu{@Quantity} is important
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: What do you say about {@Location}s
- in which moving the -month period can't solve the
- problem? For {@Event}ple, if the {@PersonType} had good income for many years going back, but then slight -- shortly before
- the {@Skill} of the plan loses his or her job, and there
- is no prospect that the {@PersonType} is going to get another
- job? Or it could be the converse, has very low income for a long period and then right before gets a job
- So you are not going to be able to cure those problems by
- moving the -month period
- What do you do then? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Well, Justice {@Person}, I think I would tie in  with respect to the {@Quantity}
- proposition, and that is if the {@PersonType}'s circumstances
- have markedly changed, then the {@PersonType} has the ability
- to file an amended plan; and that amended plan could ask
- the {@Location} to move that time {@Skill} {@PersonType} to a
- {@Skill} {@Event} that would take into account the
- drop in income
- With respect to the {@Quantity} part of your proposition, and that is an increase in income, then I
- as Chapter  {@PersonType} would have the ability to object
- to it on the basis of -- of good faith under either
- (a)() or (a)(), either the plan or the {@Skill}
- of the {@Location} itself
- And those -- the {@Skill} of the (a)() was the primary way in which all of these
- disputes were resolved before the  amendments which
- brought in subsection (b) to  which introduced the
- concept of disposable income
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: How do you file an amended plan and have the {@Location} restart the clock, when
- (A) says only if the {@PersonType} has not filed a
- schedule of current income? If there's been a plan confirmed or a plan proposed, then the income schedule
- had to have been filed
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: You don't do {@Quantity} without the other
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Those are {@Quantity} different propositions, Your {@Skill}
- {@Quantity} is if the plan is confirmed and {@Quantity} if it is not confirmed
- If it is not confirmed, then you are correct; at some point the
- {@PersonType} and the {@Location} are going to want to see a
- Schedule I and J to see what the actual income and
- expenses are
- If the plan has already been confirmed, then the ability to change the plan has to be d{@Quantity} under
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: Forget about
- I'm going to the situation where the plan has been proposed,
- let's say
- The {@Location} -- if a schedule of income has been filed, then it's without any jurisdiction to change
- the -month lookback period, correct?
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: I don't agree with the word "jurisdiction," Justice {@Person}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: Well, it can't under (A)
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: The {@PersonType} would certainly have the ability to ask the {@Location} to be excused from
- that requirement given a change in circumstances
- But again it would be the formula that would be honored,
- rather than the {@Location} substituting judicial discretion
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Can I ask -- yes, there is {@Quantity} more question
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: Okay
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Can I ask whether , which you have {@DateTime} invoked, does not provide the same
- kind of discretion to the {@Location} that you are objecting
- to? What -- what standards are there for granting or not granting modification of the plan? Is it pretty much up to the {@PersonType}? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: No
- I believe again the {@Location} is bound, Justice {@Person}, by the (A) formula
- It's obvious that {@Organization} intended the formula
- It would not make much sense to read the statute to have
- some other formula
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, then -- then -- okay
- You are between a rock and a hard place
- Either  gets you out of that formula, which is what you've said,
- it's {@Quantity} way out, or it isn't
- Which is it? {@Organization}
- {@Location}: I haven't said that it gets me out of the formula
- It gets me out of the time {@Skill} issue, because certainly the statute doesn't take into
- specific account what happens if the {@PersonType} loses a job,
- say, post-{@Skill}? Obviously -- {@Event}ple, husband loses the job at Goodyear after the {@Location}ruptcy {@Skill} is
- filed
- And I think  is broad enough to allow an amendment which would involve only moving the time
- {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Okay
- So any -- any {@Organization}
- {@Location}: I believe so, Justice {@Person}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: -- subsequent to the {@Skill}
- {@Organization}
- {@Location}: If there are no other questions I would like to reserve the remainder of my
- time, {@PersonType} {@Person}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Thank you, {@PersonType}
- Mr
- {@Person}
- ORAL ARGUMENT OF {@Person}
- {@Person} ON BEHALF OF THE {@PersonType}
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Mr
- {@PersonType}, and {@DateTime} it please the {@Location}: The {@Location}, I think, has the parties' arguments very well in hand
- I think the -- the {@Quantity} point that I can hopefully address, and it is I think
- the hardest part of our {@Location}, is to address the issue
- that Justice {@Person} raised, and that is, is there an
- anomaly in the fact that in {@Organization} {@Organization} added the
- -month period, which would suggest perhaps that
- {@Organization} was trying to lock in a particular period that
- we would look at
- And the answer to that question is no, and I want to take you to the relevant statutory provisions
- Everything is going to be in the cert {@Skill}
- I am going to start in the {@Skill} appendix at , which is
- , which is the operative provision here
- And (b)() tells us that if the {@PersonType} or a {@PersonType}
- objects, then as of the effective date of the plan it's
- only going to be confirmed in subsection (b), which is
- the {@Quantity} full paragraph on p{@Quantity}  is going to control
- The plan has to provide that all of the {@PersonType}'s {@Skill}ed disposable income to be received in
- the applicable commitment period beginning on the date
- the {@Quantity} {@Skill} is due under the plan will be applied
- to make {@Skill}s to unsecured {@PersonType}s under the plan
- And the thing to note {@Quantity} about that provision is that it, too, sets a timetable
- It's not just {@Skill}ed disposable income, but it's {@Skill}ed
- disposable income of a very particular type, to be
- received in the applicable commitment period
- So unless there is something particularly strange about the
- definition of "disposable income," {@Organization} specified a
- period that the income is going to be measured in, and
- that's over the course of the plan; the word "{@Skill}ed"
- tells us to get a realistic estimation of what that
- amount of m{@Quantity}y's going to be
- {@DateTime}, my {@PersonType} makes the point that disposable income after {@Organization} is a defined term; the
- definition comes in the next paragraph; it's subsection
- (), (b)()
- For purposes of this subsection the term "disposable income" means current {@DateTime} income
- received by the {@PersonType} subject to some deductions and
- then the expenses
- So then we have to go to the definition of "current {@DateTime} income
- " Current {@DateTime} income is in ; it's at p{@Quantity}
- That's where we get the -month period
- And it tells us that current {@DateTime} income is the aver{@Quantity}
- {@DateTime} income from all sources, so it's very
- encompassing, without regard to whether such income is
- {@Skill}able income derived during the -month period
- So, my {@PersonType}'s argument is that, well, {@Organization} said  months
- The answer to that point is a couple fold
- {@Quantity}, as was suggested in the {@Quantity} half-hour, {@Organization} was addressing a very specific
- problem there
- Before {@Organization} {@Location} didn't k{@DateTime} what the -- didn't agree on what the baseline was for
- {@Skill} some{@Quantity}'s income
- Some {@Location} would say, all right, you are a Chapter  {@PersonType}, right away I'm going to look at the
- la{@Skill} month
- Some {@Location} said  months
- We have a {@Location} in our brief that said  years
- So, we have to have a starting point to {@Skill} from
- But the {@Quantity} point is that this term "current {@DateTime} income" isn't principally a Chapter
- term at all
- So, my {@PersonType}'s argument is that {@Organization} stuck this -month period into Chapter , so it would
- be very anomalous if we could just -- in effect, he says
- we are throwing it out, we are giving the {@Location}
- {@PersonType}s discretion
- It's not quite right
- The place to look is in section , which is {@Quantity} p{@Quantity}s later
- is a Chapter  provision
- And my {@PersonType} started out by saying the problem with our
- position is that we were not following the Chapter
- means {@Skill}
- That's the key
- borrowed from Chapter
- So (b)()(A)(i) is at the
- beginning of p{@Quantity}  of the appendix
- And, so, we are in a Chapter  {@Location} here
- And this is the means {@Skill}
- It tells us that: "In considering under paragraph ," so we are trying to
- figure out if there is a presumption of abuse under
- Chapter  -- "whether the granting of relief would be an
- abuse of the provisions of this chapter, the {@Location} shall
- presume abuse exists if the {@PersonType}'s current {@DateTime}
- income, reduced by the amounts determined under clauses
- , , and " -- those are expense clauses -- "and
- multiplied by  is not less than" a certain amount
- So what happened is {@Organization} in {@Organization} created this presumption of abuse in Chapter  and it
- then borrowed that concept, as my {@PersonType} pointed out, in
- Chapter
- So that -month period has real force and effect in the {@Location}ruptcy Code in Chapter
- So it's not like {@Organization} in Chapter  fixed the -month period,
- which would give -- have a sort of a gravitational pull
- You wouldn't want to throw that out too lightly
- Justice {@Person}, I do agree that we ought to be pretty -- we ought to stick to it
- It indicates {@Organization} is concerned with the -month period
- But it's not like {@Organization} added to Chapter  this -month
- concept
- It added it to Chapter , where it's in full force and effect
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: You -- you -- you have lost me
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Okay
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Sure
- It's back
- We have to go back {@Quantity} p{@Quantity}s
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: No, I got -- I got it there
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Okay
- Sure
- I'm sorry
- Can I make {@Quantity} other point about that langu{@Quantity}, just to repeat it again? That the {@Location} The term is "current {@DateTime} income
- " So we are in Chapter , so {@Quantity} lines down"
- "The {@Location} shall presume abuse exists if the {@PersonType}'s current {@DateTime}
- income" -- that's the  months, current {@DateTime} income
- That's the -month period of income
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: I -- I -- I see
- I see
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: See, that's mostly where it matters
- Then {@Organization} borrowed it in Chapter
- But it didn't get rid of, as was pointed out before, the
- term -- "{@Skill}ed"; it didn't get rid of the period,
- the commitment period
- But I do want to point out something very particular about this langu{@Quantity}
- Here's the phrase:
- "Current {@DateTime} income, reduced by the amounts
- determined under clauses , , and " -- those are
- expenses -- "and multiplied by
- " That's what my {@PersonType} says the phrase "{@Skill}ed disposable income to
- be received over the applicable commitment period" is
- Our point is that if {@Organization} intended that {@Skill} formulation, it would have used the exact
- words that I have just read from you in Chapter ,
- because that's {@Skill}
- {@PersonType} KENNEDY: Without the word "{@Skill}ed"? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I'm sorry? {@PersonType} KENNEDY: Without the word "{@Skill}ed"? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: That's exactly
- They used "multiplied
- " And {@Organization} did that several times in {@Organization} and before {@Organization}
- When {@Organization} wanted, look, we are going to have a mathematical formula, it used a
- mathematical formula
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Why don't you follow his suggestion and just move the -month period, because
- the statute specifically grants that authority to the
- {@PersonType}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Sure
- Let me make a few points about that, sir
- So I'll again read the langu{@Quantity}
- again
- So we are on
- It says that -- little (ii) is going to be -- it's going to be " months ending on the
- date on which current income is determined by the {@Location}
- for purposes of this title if the {@PersonType} does not file
- the schedule of current income
- " A couple OF points about that
- {@PersonType} ratchet, right
- The {@PersonType} and the {@PersonType}, if the {@PersonType} a month before {@Skill} gets a new job or
- their expenses go down -- let's say you had a {@Product}, but
- you k{@DateTime} that the {@Product} {@Skill}s are going to be d{@Quantity}
- Under the {@PersonType}'s view, then you still get to count
- the {@Product} {@Skill}s which are totally pretend, or if you
- got a much higher paying job
- In fact, in this {@Location} she did get a higher paying job
- Towards the end of the period, she got a raise
- And we say that has to be counted, too
- We have to have a {@PersonType} and {@PersonType}-neutral provision
- In a statute that's designed to make sure the {@PersonType} pays a
- much as possible to her {@PersonType}s, it's very strange to
- put this entirely in the {@PersonType}'s hands
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Can I ask you this
- There seems to be at least a subtle difference between your
- position and the {@Skill}'s position
- You say that the {@Skill}ed disposable income will be different from
- the disposable income calculated during the lookback
- period when it is k{@DateTime}n or virtually certain that there
- will be differences in income or expenses
- And the {@Skill} says that there is a difference when
- something is likely to occur in the future
- Where do you -- where do you get from the statute your k{@DateTime}n or virtually certain differences? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: The contrast between  and
- What I tried to do in my brief, and I have laid it out at the beginning of the argument section
- That's where we try to {@Skill} our rule
- What we have d{@Quantity} is we have looked at the {@Location}s
- As you pointed out, this is pre-{@Organization} {@Event}
- {@Location}s have set a pretty high bar, both in terms of the level of
- certainty and the {@Quantity} of deviation
- And {@Location} have said -- I will give you an {@Event}ple that will illustrate the difference perhaps
- You have times when some{@Quantity} expects to get a raise
- They don't k{@DateTime} that they are going to get it, or they
- expect to get a {@Skill}
- And {@Location} will say, even if that's pretty likely, until you have actually got it we
- are not going to count it for purposes of (b); come
- back under
- And we point out in our merits brief that in fact, it's not quite on point, but she got a settlement
- post{@Skill} here, and under  that m{@Quantity}y was
- applied
- So, Justice {@Person}, there are post{@Skill} events, but if you k{@DateTime} a{@PersonType} of
- time -- and this {@Location} is a perfect {@Event}ple, it -- we
- k{@DateTime} she is not going to get another {@Event} from Payless
- {@Location}
- When it's k{@DateTime}n or virtually certain, we think that is sufficient -- akin to Justice {@Person}'s
- point about, you k{@DateTime}, making it hard
- Let me make {@Quantity} other point
- I wanted to finish off my answer to the {@PersonType} about
- This provision has taken on greater significance in the
- oral argument and the reply brief of the {@PersonType}
- I did want to point out to the {@Location} a provision that is
- not reproduced in the parties' {@Product}, but if the {@Location}
- were to go this route it would want to be aware of, and
- that's (i)
- And (i) tells us that you do have to file the forms at the beginning or you have to file them
- within  days, but upon request of the {@PersonType} made
- within  days after the date of {@Skill} the {@Skill},
- the {@Location} {@DateTime} allow the {@PersonType} an additional period of
- not to exceed  days
- So it does seem to constrain the power of the {@Location}ruptcy {@Location} to shift this period all
- around
- So, I have made {@Quantity} points
- {@Quantity} is it's a {@Quantity}-way ratchet for the {@PersonType}; {@Quantity}, it's not
- unlimited
- The {@Quantity} is it just doesn't make any sense
- Why would {@Organization} design a system that would have all
- of these machinations
- If we agree that {@Organization} wants -- it seems my {@PersonType} and I agree that {@Organization}
- believes that she shouldn't have to make the {@Skill}s
- that would be required under the {@PersonType}'s reading of
- "{@Skill}ed disposable income
- " The question is how we get there
- The {@PersonType}'s answer is that you are required by the text; I'm sorry, {@Organization} took this
- option away
- And I think that, as I have explained, the term "{@Skill}ed disposable income to be received in the
- applicable commitment period" really is not langu{@Quantity}
- that you would ordinarily construe to ignore changes
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, I think -- I think that's exactly right when you look at term
- "{@Skill}ed disposable income
- " {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: But if you look as {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Yes
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: -- as a defined term
- different -- different argument, different kettle of
- {@Product}
- I mean, because particularly in a statute intended to restrict discretion, it's a way to do it
- You look at it in the abstract, "{@Skill}ed disposable
- income," it doesn't achieve that objective
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: And that is exactly, Mr
- {@PersonType}, why I started with the definition of
- "current {@DateTime} income in the -month period
- " I agree that it is an important point
- It is their strongest argument
- My only point is that I have explained, I think, why {@Organization} put the -month period in for
- purposes of Chapter  and also to have the starting
- point
- If I -- to give you an {@Event}ple, take {@Skill}
- If we were to define {@Skill} as the amount in the rise
- in prices over the {@DateTime}, if {@Organization} did
- that in a statute and then told us to look at {@Skill}ed
- {@Skill}, we would still not ignore things that will
- tell us that there are going to be -- there has been an
- {@Product} price spike or an increase in health {@Product}e costs
- It would take a pretty firm, firm period that told us to
- only look into the past and not look into the future,
- particularly when the whole point of the statute is to
- make sure that the m{@Quantity}y goes into the {@PersonType}'s hands
- that the {@PersonType} is able to pay
- On the point of discretion, I should also say {@Organization} as a whole was intended to reduce discretion
- And, so, it's kind of odd to say that the answer to our
- position is to turn to all of these other discretionary
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: What if you -- you wanted to achieve your {@PersonType}'s result and you had a
- definition of disposable income, and you wanted the
- {@Location} to -- you don't want to say {@Skill} that {@PersonType},
- what -- what word would be more natural than saying
- {@Skill}ed? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I -- I -- I would use the langu{@Quantity} that {@Organization} did in
- Remember, the current {@DateTime} income reduced by the amounts determined
- under clauses , , and  and multiplied by
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: No, that's altering disposable income -- the definition of disposable
- income
- I'm asking isn't the most natural word to achieve your {@PersonType}'s result to use {@Skill}ed
- What other word would you say when you say this is the period
- you look at and you want to take it {@PersonType}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Multiply
- And {@Organization} did that a bunch of times
- Projected -- if we try to
- {@Skill} something, we try and make the -- and everybody
- agrees on the definition, so really, it's not an unusual
- term
- It is: You make your best {@Skill} of the future based on the {@Skill} you have {@DateTime}
- My {@PersonType} is right
- {@Quantity} piece of {@Skill} we have {@DateTime} is her {@DateTime}'
- income
- Another piece of {@Skill} is we k{@DateTime} that she's not going to have the same income in the future
- If there are no further questions
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Thank you, Counsel
- Ms
- {@Person}
- ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH {@Person} ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING {@PersonType} {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Mr
- {@PersonType}, and {@DateTime} it please the {@Location}: In {@Location}ruptcy, as in many areas of the {@Skill}, {@Organization} has tried to balance on the {@Quantity} hand, doing
- {@Location}-specific {@Skill}, and on the other hand, ensuring
- that the statutory scheme is administrable
- {@DateTime}, {@Organization} certainly could have chosen to elevate
- simpli{@Location} over accuracy by telling {@Location}ruptcy {@Location} to
- take a {@PersonType}'s current disposable income and multiply
- that number by the number of months in the plan in
- assessing whether the plan is confirmable
- But there are several strong signals in the {@Skill} that that is
- actually not what {@Organization} intended {@Location} to do
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: But do you think {@Location}ruptcy {@Location} are supposed to be {@Skill} forecasters? For {@Event}ple, if you -- after calculating the {@PersonType}'s income
- during the -month period, the -month lookback period,
- should the {@Location}ruptcy {@Location} said, well -- say: Well, it's -- {@Skill} is {@Skill}ed to be such-and-such over
- the term of this plan, so I am just going to increase it
- by the amount of {@Skill}; or: This person works in a particular industry where historically, over the last
- {@DateTime} or ten years, there's been a  {@Quantity}
- increase in salary per year, so I'm going to multiply it
- by -- multiply the disposable income figure like that? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Certainly not, Justice {@Person}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, why not? You say that the {@Location}ruptcy {@Location} should take into account things
- that are likely to occur in the future
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: we are not saying that {@Location}ruptcy {@Location} should ever
- speculate about what might happen in the future
- What we are saying is that {@Location}ruptcy {@Location} should take into
- account what they k{@DateTime}, in this {@Location}, already has
- happened, but also what they k{@DateTime} will happen
- And so to give an {@Event}ple of a change that would benefit
- {@PersonType}s, if as -- as I menti{@Quantity}d earlier, if a {@PersonType}
- has secured a higher-paying job just before or just
- after she filed her {@Skill}, a {@Location} should be able to
- take into account the fact that her income going {@PersonType}
- would be greater than would be reflected in the
- {@Skill} of her current disposable income
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, "k{@DateTime} will happen" is quite different from "likely to happen," and I thought
- your {@Skill} was likely to happen
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, likely to happen based on what you k{@DateTime} {@DateTime}
- I think -- we haven't suggested a particular burden of proof
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Not -- not likely, based on what you k{@DateTime}
- Well, that's quite different from you k{@DateTime} it will happen
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Right
- So there is an {@Event}ple menti{@Quantity}d earlier: If the {@PersonType} is repaying a loan to her (k) program, that is the type of loan
- that can't be extended time-wise
- And so she will keep making those {@Skill}s, which will be deducted as an
- expense in the {@Skill} of her current disposable
- income, but -- but you k{@DateTime} at a certain point, she is
- likely to stop making those {@Skill}s
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: Is there a difference between your {@Skill} and the {@PersonType}'s {@Skill}?
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Not according to what I heard Mr
- {@Person} say at the argument
- Again, we do {@PersonType} {@PersonType}: His words were "k{@DateTime}n to a virtual certainty," which are -- likely to happen is
- different than likely to happen
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I think, in part, it depends on what type of change you are talking about
- Again, we would never say that a {@Location} should speculate
- about what should happen
- But, for instance, to take another {@Event}ple on the expense side, if a {@PersonType} when
- she proposes her plan owns a {@Quantity} {@Product}, a vacation
- {@Product} that is secured by a mortg{@Quantity}, then that secured
- debt {@Skill} is an expense that would be deducted from
- her income in the {@Skill} of her current disposable
- income
- But if she proposes to surrender that property as a condition of her plan, she will no longer have that
- debt {@Skill} going {@PersonType}
- And so that's the type of -- so it will no longer be an expense going {@PersonType}
- Under {@PersonType}'s view, a {@Location} would not be able to
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: That's -- that's "k{@DateTime} will happen
- " That is "k{@DateTime} will happen
- " But I don't k{@DateTime} how you can, at {@Quantity} and the same time, say: {@Location}s shall not speculate, and then say that the {@Skill} is
- "likely to happen
- " {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@PersonType} {@Person}: I mean, to -- you k{@DateTime}, to look {@PersonType} and say: Is it likely or not likely? That's {@Skill}
- I don't k{@DateTime} a better definition of {@Skill}, to tell you the truth
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Okay
- But then, we wouldn't -- we are not trying to advance that view of
- "likely
- " And again, in this {@Location} the change had already occurred, so there is no uncertainty about what
- her situation is {@DateTime} and what we can {@Skill} it to be
- going {@PersonType}
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: It seems to me that,
- well, depending on how broad a theory you are adopting
- of what's {@Skill}ed and what's not, that you are taking
- into account a lot of things that are more properly
- taken into account when it comes to whether the plan
- should be confirmed or not
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: What's going to happen? What's the situation going to be? What should, you k{@DateTime}, the {@PersonType}s get? What should the {@PersonType} get? There is no reason to kind of shoehorn those into the {@Skill}ed disposable income
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, except that if the {@PersonType} or a {@PersonType} objects, then the {@Skill} of
- {@Skill}ed disposable income is {@Quantity} of the conditions of
- confirmability of the plan
- The {@Location} can't confirm it {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, is that -- I mean, let's say your {@PersonType} wins up to the point and
- somebody else, when it gets to {@Skill}, can say:
- Well, look, you k{@DateTime}, there was this big payout before
- the {@Skill}
- So don't confirm it
- We k{@DateTime} she has got all this -- all this other m{@Quantity}y
- That -- it could do it that way, couldn't it? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I'm sorry, if she got a higher-paying job just before? Is that what you're suggesting? {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, whatever the situation is, can't that be taken into account when it
- comes to {@Skill}? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, it could affect the -- well, {@Quantity} thing that is important to note that hasn't
- been brought up is under Section (a)(), the {@Location}
- is actually -- which is the feasibility provision -- the
- {@Location} is actually required to think about what is going
- to happen in the future, whether a {@PersonType} is going to be
- able to repay her {@PersonType}s
- And so it doesn't make
- very much sense to, on the {@Quantity} hand, require a {@Location} to
- consider what it k{@DateTime}s will happen in the future in
- {@Skill} feasibility, and then on the other hand, if
- there's an objection by the {@PersonType} or the {@PersonType} and
- (b) comes into play, to prohi{@Quantity} a {@Location} from
- considering the same facts it k{@DateTime}s about what is going
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: What if the {@PersonType} is a waiter and during the last month of the -month period,
- because of some change of the {@Skill} the waiter's tips
- have g{@Quantity} up either way up or way down? What's the {@Location} supposed to do then? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, I think {@Quantity} purpose of having the -month lookback period in the {@Skill}
- of current income is exactly to take into account those
- situations
- There are many people who are gainfully employed full time, but whose -- whose income fluctuates
- over time
- And so requiring that {@Location} use the -month lookback period, I think, gives {@PersonType}s a better sense
- of whether the current income figure provided by the
- {@PersonType} is accurate
- It reduces the chance for strategic {@Skill} because it sort of takes some of the significance
- away of the time of {@Skill}
- And so it seems fairer in that {@Location} to consider that -month aver{@Quantity} in a {@Location} where income
- fluctuates up and down as an accurate sense of what the
- -- what the {@PersonType}'s current income is
- And again, in many -- in a significant number of {@Location}s the {@Skill}
- of a current disposable income will be a good prediction
- of what the {@PersonType}'s disposable income will be going
- {@PersonType}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: How do you deal with the {@PersonType}'s -- the {@Quantity} arguments {@PersonType} makes? {@Quantity} is that on the expense side, {@Organization} provided for
- special circumstances, exceptions, and it didn't on the
- income side? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, the special circumstances exception comes in, in the {@Skill} of
- the {@PersonType}'s current disposable income, but it doesn't
- tell you what to do in terms of {@Skill}ing that
- disposable income
- And so you can adjust what you think the current disposable income is based on an expense
- that isn't accounted for in the standard expenses or an
- expense that is accounted for, but is higher than is
- accounted for in those expenses
- But again, it doesn't tell you what to do -- how to {@Skill} that number going
- {@PersonType}
- {@PersonType} {@Person}: What about the argument that this is a simple thing; she didn't have to file the
- plan -- she didn't have to file the {@Skill} at a time
- when those {@Quantity} months would be in the -month lookback
- She could have waited
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: Well, that is certainly true of this {@PersonType}, of the {@PersonType} in this {@Location}
- That is not an option available to all {@PersonType}s, many of
- whom are facing {@Skill} proceedings or imminent
- {@Skill} proceedings
- Delay is simply not an option
- And if I could address Section (A)(A)(ii) option that the {@PersonType} offers -- I
- mean, {@Quantity} thing to note is it doesn't give the {@Location} the
- discretion to set any other -- to just pick any other
- -month lookback period
- They pick a date and go  months back from whatever that date is
- So if a change occurs very soon before the {@Skill} of the {@Skill}, it
- makes it very hard for a {@Location} to use that provision to
- change the lookback period because you would have to
- wait  months, essentially, after the {@Skill} of the
- {@Skill} to set it back
- But again, the biggest problem with using that section as a workaround is that that is an option
- that is available to {@PersonType}s, but not to {@PersonType}s
- If a {@PersonType} files a Chapter  {@Skill} along with all the
- Schedules that are required under Section  of the
- {@Skill}, then the {@PersonType} has no option for -- excuse me,
- the {@PersonType} has no option and the {@PersonType} has no
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Well, the {@PersonType} has the option of objecting the {@Skill} of the
- plan
- {@Organization}
- {@Person}: They can object to {@Skill} of the plan, but on what -- what basis? If the {@PersonType} argues that the {@Skill} of {@Skill}ed
- disposable income is merely a {@Skill} multiplication
- of the current disposable income times  or , then
- they have no way of allowing the {@Location} to take account
- of a change that has happened just before or after the
- time of the {@Skill} that would inure to the {@PersonType}'s
- benefit
- {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: They can't say: I object because the -month period is unrepresentative
- because of this particular event? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: They could say that, but it's not clear in the {@Skill} that that is a basis for
- refusing to confirm a plan
- I think they would have to {@PersonType} {@PersonType} {@Person}: Does the {@Skill} have a position on that? {@Organization}
- {@Person}: I think unless there were bad faith it's not clear how that can be a basis for not
- confirming a plan, and that was the -- the reason that
