 about Australia
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, wouldn't your clients have an adequate remedy under Australian law in 
Australia, in the Australian court system? MR
 DUBBS: We might or we might not
 But that is not determinative
 JUSTICE ALITO: that they do not
 Let's assume that on the facts of this case they could not prevail under Australian law in 
the Australian court system
 Then what United States MR
 DUBBS: JUSTICE ALITO: -- that should override that? MR
 DUBBS: There is a strong United States interest
 It's on two levels
 The first strong United States -- United States interest deals with the conduct 
at issue here, namely the conduct in Florida by 
HomeSide
 This was the sixth largest mortgage service provider in the United States
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we had only HomeSide's conduct, nothing else, there wouldn't be any violation 
of (b); is that right? MR
 DUBBS: We do not agree with that, Your Honor
 We believe that they made a representation by  
 creating the false numbers, or otherwise it's within the 
scope of the statute
 What they did is create a JUSTICE GINSBURG: But nothing has happened
 Suppose it had been caught by the Australian bank, and 
they didn't act on it? MR
 DUBBS: Your -- Your Honor, that goes to a different element of the cause of action
 That doesn't go to the scope of the statute
 That goes to how the private cause of action is enforced
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, I concede your argument that a big component of this fraud was what 
went on in Florida, but it needed to be disclosed to the 
public
 It needed to be put out there
 And that wasn't done in Florida by the Florida defendants
 MR
 DUBBS: It was done in Australia and we can prove that
 And -- the point is we are not -- all we are proving through doing that is the effects of the 
fraud in Florida
 To use Professor Beale's example, where you have poison candy in one jurisdiction, that 
poison candy is sent to another jurisdiction, and in the 
first jurisdiction there is a law that says "thou shalt 
not make poison candy;" through the exercise of 
legislative jurisdiction that statute in the first 
jurisdiction is appropriate, and both jurisdictions have  
 an interest in that
 Now, if we are in the poison candy jurisdiction and we are bringing a case about poison 
candy, if the statute in addition says, "you have to 
show some harm from the poison candy," indeed you might 
as a matter of proof have to show effects from that 
other forum
 But that's different than regulating conduct in the second forum or anything else in the 
second forum
 That is simply looking at the statute or the legal prescription against making poison candy
 And we say section (b) is like the poison candy statute
 JUSTICE ALITO: JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's -- I would like you to follow that up specifically
 That is, in my mind the difficult issue in this case is not the 
jurisdictional issue under principles of international 
law
 It's the question of the scope of the statute
 And there the things against you are three
 One is Professor Sachs's argument, which I would like to know 
your answer to
 The second is in Judge Friendly's two opinions
 The first opinion -- the second one, rather, Bersch, he says if you had a foreign exchange and 
foreign plaintiffs as -- and there was no foreign 
plaintiff, the security issued over a foreign exchange,  
 even if that fraud takes place totally in the United 
States, the statute wouldn't cover it
 That's Friendly, which started this
 And the third thing is what he says in Leasco
 He says: We cannot see any sound reason for not taking your position, at least for the plaintiffs 
who are Americans
 Okay? Now, France, Britain and Australia have filed briefs in this case giving what they consider very 
sound reasons, which are reasons that Judge Friendly 
never considered
 And those three reasons, as we know, is they point to a number of conflicts, that if you win, 
how that will interfere with their efforts to regulate 
their own securities markets, right? That's all one question: Professor Sachs, Friendly in Bersch, and Friendly in Leasco
 But that's what I'd like to hear your answer to
 MR
 DUBBS: I will try to keep the subparts in mind
 Why don't we start from the end and try to work backwards
 Perhaps one of the most important parts of the record is the Solicitor General's view that as a 
general matter -- and I will get to the specifics; I'm 
not ducking that
 But as a general matter the enforcement of the securities laws, unlike the antitrust 
laws, has not historically and today they do not believe  
 runs -- raises a substantial risk of interstate 
conflict
 Now, as to the specific briefs that Your Honor referenced, if we look at those briefs and we look 
at those compared to what happened in Hartford Fire, 
those briefs -- and let's focus on Australia's for the 
moment because that's the country we are talking about
 
Australia's brief essentially says they have a 
regulatory system that may -- that we may or may not 
have been able to litigate this cause of action in 
Australia, but let's assume that we could
 They are not saying -- they did not say in that brief that there was some fundamental conflict, 
like the plurality found in Hartford Fire; nor did they 
say that there was the kind of conflict that comes up in 
the application of (h) of the Restatement, which 
Justice Scalia looked to in his opinion in Hartford 
Fire
 So there is not the kind of conflict that leads necessarily -- necessarily -- to not reasonably applying 
the statute
 The reason there's not is that because, one, there is not a rule in Australia that one has to abide 
by and a rule in the United States that one has to abide 
by that are contradictory
 At most, what you have is you have a clear rule in the United States that says  
 thou shalt not commit fraud in Florida through either 
the Florida through either -- for or in interstate 
commerce, the mails or through an exchange
 And on the other side of the equation what you have is maybe they 
could have brought suit over here and we have a robust 
regulatory system and a robust litigation system; more 
power to them
 But that doesn't mean -- saying that, that doesn't mean that the first State where the poison candy 
was made suddenly has no interest in that
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but -- but Australia says: Look, it's up to us to decide whether there has been a misrepresentation, point one; and whether it's 
been relied upon by the -- by the plaintiffs, point two
 
And we should be able to decide that and we don't want 
it decided by a foreign court
 You are talking about a misrepresentation, if there was one in this case, made in Australia to 
Australian purchasers; it ought to be up to us to decide 
that issue; and here you are dragging the American 
courts into it
 MR
 DUBBS: Well, let me deal with the dragging in part in a minute, because that's 
subliminally very important to the case
 But let me address the direct question
 He  
 Australians may believe that, but the question is was 
there a misrepresentation both in the United States and 
possibly in Australia? If there was in Australia, that's for the Australians
 That's dealing with the effects of eating the poison candy
 But we say a JUSTICE SCALIA: Not to these plaintiffs
 MR
 DUBBS: JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you have to join the misrepresentation to the plaintiff
 MR
 DUBBS: JUSTICE SCALIA: The only misrepresentation to these plaintiffs was made in Australia by an 
Australian company
 MR
 DUBBS: There are two ways to connect the fraud to the plaintiffs
 The one is the "in connection with" requirement that deals with conduct, 
which we meet, and this Court has construed very broadly 
in Dabit, in Zandford and any other number of cases
 
That's number one
 Number two, assuming that the scope of the statute is broad enough to cover the conduct in Florida, 
we then get to the second question, which is the 
reasonableness of the application of the statute, and 
without a conflict, we would then look at -- to the  
 interest of the United States and compare them to the 
Australians
 And the Australians can say, we can -- you know, we can go after eating that poison candy
 And we say, fine, if you want to, that's great
 But that doesn't mean we can't go after the act of poisoning the 
candy in Florida
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- that isn't the issue
 The -- the -- the issue for the Australians is: We want to determine whether there has been a 
misrepresentation or not
 MR
 DUBBS: JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't want the determination of whether there has been a 
misrepresentation on the Australian exchange and whether 
Australian purchasers relied upon that misrepresentation 
to be determined by an American court
 MR
 DUBBS: And we say more power to you, you can decide that question
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not if it's decided here, unless you want to say, the Australian court to say, the 
United States taking this case is so outrageous that we 
will not respect its judgment
 And that's a factor, too
 It's -- what conflict of laws is all about is you have two jurisdictions, both with an interest in 
applying their own law, but sometimes one defers to the  
 other
 MR
 DUBBS: That's correct, Your Honor
 And the question is should there be deferral in this case
 
And we say if you apply the standards of -- of Hartford 
Fire or the standards of the Restatement, you don't end 
up in deferral
 You end up in prosecution of the Section (b) cause of action in Florida
 And you do that for a couple of different reasons
 First, you look at the magnitude of the conduct in Florida, the size of this
 This is a $
 billion writedown in a portfolio
 You have a portfolio of $ billion worth of mortgages sitting 
down in Jacksonville, Florida
 Those are all mortgages on American homes,  million American homes
 So, this is not just Australia, Australia, Australia
 That's what's in the portfolio and that's what's being 
misrepresented
 And when they doctor the numbers and send them to Australia, it's a misrepresentation of 
that
 In addition, you have the overarching consideration of is it appropriate to sue National 
Australia Bank in the United States at -- at a -- at a 
more abstract level? And the answer to that, we submit, is yes
 They have invested -- if you care to look, it's on the SA- and SA- of the supplemental appendix,  
 they have invest -- they have $ billion worth of 
assets here
 They own a bank in Michigan, they have a huge trading operation on Park Avenue that trades 
billions of dollars in derivatives every day
 This is not the situation -- this is not the stereotype of a 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those derivatives are not at issue here, right? MR
 DUBBS: CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I presume -- I'm sorry, go ahead
 MR
 DUBBS: They are only at issue in the following sense, which is that the position on the 
mortgage servicing rights was hedged in New York
 When the hedge came undone, there were losses in New York on 
the other side of the hedge
 That goes to the point of were there any affects in the United States, because 
there seems to be some confusion on that
 There were some effects here from the hedge
 There were some effects on -- in the ADR market, but we are not -- we 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: MR
 DUBBS: -- disputing that most of the effects were over there
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Dubbs, Morrison, the  
 first-named plaintiff, was a derivative holder
 MR
 DUBBS: No, Your Honor
 He was the holder of an ADR
 The derivatives come in because they are the activity in New York that is the other side of 
the transaction
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you have -- you have two classes of plaintiffs, one the Australians, who 
bought their shares in Australia; then you have 
Morrison, who has an ADR, and who is dismissed because 
he wasn't able to show damages
 MR
 DUBBS: That's true
 There -- there are no Americans left
 This is strictly Australians
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what U
S
 investor was harmed? MR
 DUBBS: The -- the question is, were there effects on the U
S
 market? There were U
S
 investors who were, in all likelihood, harmed but none 
have stepped forward with respect to ADR holders
 But if the question in the abstract is were there economic 
effects from this transaction in the United States, the 
answer is -- is yes, there were fallout from -- on -- on 
the derivative side, which is the other side -- which 
was the other side, in effect, the short side of what 
the long position was, which was $ billion worth of 
mortgages in Florida that what is -- what the portfolio  
 consisted of
 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you -- do you want to finish? MR
 DUBBS: No, Your Honor
 JUSTICE BREYER: Then -- I mean, I can see
 I will give you all that
 That isn't what is bothering me
 I think you are right so far as what you have argued
 But the part that I think is most difficult is why I -- I shorthand referred to Professor Sachs' 
article
 MR
 DUBBS: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Because what Australia is actually saying is what we don't like about -- about the 
American system, you know, their -- their common 
criticisms of class actions
 We say, first of all, the American rule means even if our companies here are 
right, that they are going to have to pay their legal 
fees
 We don't like punitive damages
 We don't like that we have the opt-out
 And these are all our citizens, and we don't want to subject our companies on 
our exchange to that stuff
 Now, fine, they have a reason on their side
 Then Professor Sachs says: Read the statute, because they argue -- it was never intended to cover that kind 
of stuff
 Now, that's what I would like you to address  
 specifically
 MR
 DUBBS: Well, it was -- there are two issues
 The statute was intended to cover that kind of stuff if the antecedent of "stuff" is fraud in Florida
 
Now, that's a separate question from how we deal with 
the private right of action in these circumstances
 Now, let's back up
 The general criticism of these cases is that they are gotcha cases
 You put in a little bit and all of a sudden the private bar 
comes and attacks you
 I mean, that's the stereotype
 Well, the stereotype is wrong and it's important to 
understand why the stereotype is wrong
 Because if all you have is a very modest investment in the ADR market, 
 percent like my friends from NAB, those cases get 
bounced at the beginning on personal jurisdiction as 
they did in the district of New Jersey in SCORS and the 
Novagold case
 We are not aware of any case where if all you've got is that little toehold that you stay in
 
You get bounced by -- on personal jurisdiction
 And to pick up on the discussion that I was having with Justice Ginsburg, we thought that in 
addition to that, if the Court wanted to send signals 
with respect to these kinds of cases, if you put, as you 
can, Sinochem at the beginning of the train, even more 
of these cases if they are fallacious are going to be  
 screened out of the system
 So, the point is that we can all tell our Australian friends that there are very rigid safeguards 
in place so that this horror story in reality doesn't 
happen and it has not been proven to happen
 It is an attractive myth, but it hasn't happened
 Those cases go out and they go out early
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that it happens in advance of considerable discovery
 I -- I --I would agree that the judge can confine discovery to 
forum non conveniens or for personal jurisdiction, but 
in -- in these cases one of the things we are really 
talking about is the burden of discovery
 That's the cost of litigation
 You know that
 MR
 DUBBS: I do know that and let me answer briefly, because I want to reserve my time for rebuttal
 
I disagree with your fundamental observation, Justice 
Kennedy
 These cases are paid attention to by the district judges and they go out early
 They go out early on personal jurisdiction; there is not a lot of 
discovery on that
 They go out early -- if Sinochem gets applied faithfully, it would go out early on that 
if there is a close question
 And then you go to the (b)()
 And pursuant to the Private Securities  
 Litigation Reform Act, one of the purposes of that is no 
discovery, no discovery until after the motion to 
dismiss is decided
 So it is not true that there is a lot of discovery, there is a lot of transaction costs, before 
we know the answer to one of the threshold questions, 
which is: Should this case be in our system or not? That can be handled and it is being handled on a daily 
basis, notwithstanding, you know, some stereotypes
 Now, my final point with respect to Professor Sachs' articles and some of the other articles 
is they in effect -- if they advocate a rule, which many 
of them do, which it should be limited to exchanges, 
that goes back to my threshold point of the scope of the 
statute
 And it takes an eraser to the statute and it says: It's only exchanges; it's not in connection with foreign or interstate commerce or through the mails; 
it's limited, contrary to the express words of the 
statute, in a way that the statutory construction we 
don't believe can stand it
 Now, there are other legitimate ways of cabining the private cause of action
 But that -- if you are faithful to the statute, we submit that is not 
one of them
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,  
 Mr
 Dubbs
 Mr
 Conway
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE T
 CONWAY, III, ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS MR
 CONWAY: Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed for two reasons
 First, Petitioners have identified nothing in the text of section (b) that overcomes the 
presumption against extraterritoriality or the Charming 
Betsy Rule
 The statutes should thus be construed not to apply to transactions and shares of foreign issuers 
on foreign exchanges
 Second, unlike the rights of action that this Court has addressed in other extraterritoriality 
cases, the section (b) right is purely implied
 
Congress didn't intend for this right of action to exist 
even domestically, let alone extraterritorially
 Given the threat that the section (b} implied right presents to the sovereign authority of 
other nations, as reflected in the amicus briefs of 
Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and the 
diplomatic note from the Swiss government, the Court 
should construe the implied right not to extend to  
 claims of purchasers and sellers of securities of 
foreign issuers on foreign markets
 The two clear statement rules are, obviously, the presumption against extraterritoriality 
and the Charming Betsy Rule require that the Congress
 
Both require an affirmative intention of the Congress 
clearly expressed before the statute can be applied to 
apply to foreign transactions or to, you know, matters 
that it infringes on the sovereign authority on other 
nations
 My friends don't identify anything in the statute that comets even close to a clear statement
 
They principally rely on the definition of "interstate 
commerce," but as this court said in Aramco, that kind 
of boilerplate simply doesn't suffice to overcome the 
presumption against extraterritoriality
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what is your test for whether -- whether it's being applied internationally or 
not? MR
 CONWAY: Well, our test is that, at a minimum, section b should be held not to apply to 
transactions involving shares of foreign issues on 
foreign exchanges, because that presents the greatest 
danger of conflict of foreign law, particularly in the 
context of the modern section b implied right, which  
 has the fraud on the market presumption and holds 
issuers liable, as here for example, for two and a half 
years of trading, all on an Australian exchange
 That is massive transfer of wealth that the Petitioners here 

basically, it's a direct form of market regulation that 
Australia has not seen fit to impose upon itself
 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you on that point: Supposing the class of plaintiffs included a group of Americans who were shareholders of the 
Australian bank and who -- but who purchased their stock 
over the Australian exchange
 MR
 CONWAY: We would -- well, we would submit that that rule should be the same
 That they should -- they should not also, they should not be 
allowed to sue under section b
 They -- they -- you know, those people chose to purchase on the Australian 
exchange
 And in terms of the threat to international comity, I think it would be probably take -- I don't 
think other countries would take nicely to a -- to a 
rule of law that would allow Americans, essentially, to 
bring their rules, their law, their remedies, fraud, on 
JUSTICE BREYER: Give me reasons for it
 The strongest one for it, the strongest example against  
 you it seems to me, is Judge Friendly's example
 
Schmidt, a citizen of Germany, flies to New York and 
meets Jones in the hotel
 And Jones says, I have a bridge I want to sell you
 Look out the window
 Say, Do you own the Brooklyn Bridge? Yes
 And that's a lie
 Here's what you do
 You invest in buying shares of my company sold on the German exchange
 Okay? MR
 CONWAY: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Conduct took place in the United States, a terrible fraud
 This is contrary to fraud and, says, I think, Judge Friendly and others, it 
should apply at least where Schmidt is an American 
citizen and Professor Sachs says no, not even then
 What do you do with that case? The fraud took place totally here
 MR
 CONWAY: Well, I disagree with that, Your Honor, I think the fraud is carried out when the 
transaction occurs in a foreign country
 But I do agree JUSTICE BREYER: Sign the paper here in New York
 MR
 CONWAY: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Sign the paper, right here, and give me the money, because I have an urgent 
appointment
  
 MR
 CONWAY: Yes, sir
 (Laughter
) MR
 CONWAY: That's a much different case, obviously, than the fraud in the market case that we 
have here
 But Your Honor, yes, that is a stronger circumstance
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but your position and hers is: That's no more a valid claim than this one or any other one we dream up
 That's why it's a pure example, and I want to know how you feel about it
 
MR
 CONWAY: Well, I think that -- I think the problem is, in order to have that conduct swept 
within the statute, you have to ignore the language and 
the presumption against extraterritoriality
 If you go to petition appendix , that has its text in section b, and section b refers to the 
use or employment of any manipulative device or 
contrivance, and it's in connection with the purchase or 
sale of any security registered on a national securities 
exchange
 JUSTICE BREYER: Or any other
 Or -- read the next word
 MR
 CONWAY: That's correct
 Any security not so registered
 And this Court has held -- it has 
 held in cases like Aramco, American Banana, Moritson, 
that the words "any" and "every," words of universal 
scope, do not -- do not mean that these -- that 
something referred to is anything, anywhere else in the 
world
 And for example, the Court is small against the United States
 In the case where the presumption of extraterritoriality didn't really apply the court held 
that in a statute, you normally assume that things being 
referred to are thing in the United States
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the government going to tell us that its test, which differs from the foreign 
exchange test, is based on considerations like those 
suggested in Justice Breyer's Brooklyn Bridge 
hypothetical? MR
 CONWAY: I think they do
 I think they look to -- I think their view is that the statute is 
vague and you have to do essentially what Judge Friendly 
did and the Seventh Circuit did for many years, is you 
have to make do and decide what the best rule is
 And with respect to the government, that is essentially 
doing what this Court has said under the presumption 
against extraterritoriality the Court shouldn't do
 
That's essentially legislating, trying to figure out 
what Congress would have done, had "a particular 
 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would the limitations on discovery give you substantial protection were we to 
adopt the government's test or say the foreign exchange 
test with the subset exceptions for the -- that takes 
account of the government's test? MR
 CONWAY: Your Honor, I think the problem with the government's test and with the Second Circuit's 
test, is that it would still allow the application of U
S
 law in a manner that would infringe the sovereign authority of other nations
 And I can give an example
 There was a case over the summer that the Petitioners attached to their 
first supplemental brief on the petition for certiorari
 
And it's a case called PC shifts
 And it's an interesting case because it involved a Canadian company 
with headquarters in Britain and most of whose shares 
traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange
 And what happened there was that the CEO spent time in Florida -- it was a shipping company
 
We spent time in, Miami running the show from Miami
 
And the court of appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in a 
ruling that it held was consistent with the Second 
Circuit decision in this case held that nonetheless, the 
application of U
S
 law could be applied to transactions 
 of -- of foreign plaintiffs on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it a consideration that MR
 CONWAY: Yes, discovery alone
 Yes, Your Honor
 Discovery alone
 I think the French brief, for example, points that out
 I think a number of the brief -- there have been blocking statutes that have 
been enacted by various countries because of the -- what 
they deem to be the offensive scope of discovery
 In France, you are really only allowed to obtain evidence 
that is actually admissible in trial
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure how you interpret the language that you -- that you just read, 
when you say to use or employ in connection with the 
purchase or sale of any security registered on the 
National Security Exchange or any security not so 
registered
 Now, is it your point that in order to avoid an international extension of it, it should apply only 
to securities? What? MR
 CONWAY: JUSTICE SCALIA: Securities purchased and sold in the United States? Is that it? MR
 CONWAY: That -- that's correct, Your  
 Honor
 I think that's a fair reading of the statute
 And this Court is required, under both the presumption 
against extraterritoriality under its decision and the 
Charming Betsy Rule to interpret a statute, take the 
permissible construction of the statute that is least 
likely to result in an extraterritorial of the law
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Purchased -- purchased or sold? MR
 CONWAY: Purposed or sold, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if it's not -- what if it -- what if the fraud produces neither a purchase or a 
sale but induces somebody to hold on to stock that 
otherwise the person would dispose of? MR
 CONWAY: Well, I -- I don't know that that would state a claim, a private claim under Blue 
Chip Stamps
 And any -- and if the share or the securities are held abroad, if it's a foreign security, 
and I think the liability in that hypothetical -- I'm 
assuming that if it's a foreign security held by a 
foreigner -- that really would be something that would 
be subject to foreign law, whether or not Australia 
wants to represent -- recognize holder claims of the 
sort that this Court rejected in Blue Chip Stamps
 
That's a question for Australia to decide
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under these same  
 facts if you had -- altering according to the 
hypothetical, you had U
S
 plaintiffs who purchased 
National Australia Bank ADRs on the New York exchange, 
you don't doubt that they can sue, do you? MR
 CONWAY: No, and in fact, we told the district court, we did not move to defense on 
extraterritoriality grounds the claims of Mr
 Morrison, 
who inexplicably is still here
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right
 MR
 CONWAY: We argued that Mr
 Morrison's claims should be defeated on the grounds that he had no 
damages, which was an absolutely ironclad calculation 
best based on a -- on a provision of the PSLRA, and we 
also argued that all of the claims should be dismissed 
for failure to plead fraud with the requisite 
particularity of the PSLRA
 But we certainly do not dispute that when a company like ours registers shares on -- registers 
shares with the SEC, ADRs with its SEC and lists them on 
a New York stock exchange, it's subjecting itself to New 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably that would impose the same discovery on the bank as the 
Sudanese case
 MR
 CONWAY: It could, Your Honor, that's  
 absolutely true
 But on the other hand, I mean, a lot of the other aspects of -- of this litigation, which 
this Court has, you know, noted that is potentially 
highly vexatious, I mean, that is only 
 percent of 
the flow -- of the total equity securities of the -- the 
National Australia Bank
 So the dangers of -- of a threat of -- of coerced settlements is much, much less
 It's a much, much easier case to deal with if -- if -- if you are only dealing with the ADRs
 Now if another company decides to list half its equity on 
the New York Stock Exchange, well, it can -- it makes 
the determination for itself, how much of this kind of 
litigation it wants to subject itself to
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there were litigation with substantial allegations of wire fraud 
violations as predicate for RICO violations, and the 
case begins to proceed, and then there is a second cause 
of action under the securities law
 Would -- would the fact that there is going to be discovery and substantial 
litigation in the -- in the United States courts be a 
factor in retaining the -- the securities violation in 
this suit? Or would the test be just the same in your view? MR
 CONWAY: I think the -- I think you have to take each statute separately
 You have to look at  
 what the language of the statute says, whether it -- it 
admits fault in an extraterritorial reading, and whether 
that -- frankly whether that extraterritorial reading is 
required or compelled
 If there is any other possible construction, as the Court said in -- in Charming Betsy, 
the court is required to accept that construction, 
accept the construction that doesn't result in 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the -- on the extraterritorial presumption against it, your colleague 
on the other side tells us that in all the cases where 
the presumption applied, all of the conduct was 
someplace else, and they give the Aramco case and say 
MR
 CONWAY: JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and everything happened outside the country
 MR
 CONWAY: JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here, I mean, you have to concede that a component of the alleged fraud occurred 
in Florida
 MR
 CONWAY: We do concede that some of the conduct that ultimately, you know, led -- in a but-for 
causal relationship to what happened in the Australia 
occurred in the United States, but that's true in a lot  
 of other cases
 For example, Aramco, Mr
 Boureslan was hired in Houston
 So was the cook in Foley Brothers v
 Filardo
 And in Microsoft v
 AT&T, basically all of the conduct, the relevant conduct was in the United States, 
because what the -- what section (f) proscribed in 
Microsoft was the shipment -- the supply in or from the 
United States of a component of a patented invention
 And what this Court held in Microsoft was that notwithstanding AT&T's argument that, "Hey, the 
presumption against extraterritoriality doesn't really 
apply because this is just regulating the supply in and 
from the United States," this Court held that the 
presumption against extraterritoriality applied because 
what would happen is, a single act of supply would 
result in a springboard for liability each time a -- a 
disk was put into a computer abroad
 And that is exactly analogous to the circumstances in this case, where what we -- what 
happened was some -- some allegedly false information 
was transmitted to Australia; it was then republished in 


allegedly, as they would have it -- resulted in 

purchased a share of stock of the National Australia  
 Bank on the Australian securities exchange
 And so that is exactly analogous to -- to Microsoft v
 AT&T
 Again, another point I think that's relevant is the, section  of the Exchange Act
 Congress did not make a clear statement in section 
 It did make clear statements in section 
 Section (a) addresses transactions on foreign exchanges
 Section  as a whole is entitled Foreign Exchanges, and section (a) 
makes it -- makes -- gives the SEC power to promulgate 
regulations that -- that apply to brokers and dealers 
who effect transactions of securities on foreign 
exchanges, if those transactions are transactions of 
shares of shares of U
S
 issuers
 And that's at -- for reference, the text of section  is at page  of the law professors' brief
 
And section (b) also, it says that the SEC can 

of businesses -- securities that are abroad, but only to 
the extent the SEC finds it necessary to prevent evasion 
of the Act domestically
 And so Congress made two clear statements in section 
 It did not make any clear statement in section 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, is that your only point? Or is your point also that you wouldn't need  
 MR
 CONWAY: JUSTICE SCALIA: -- were read as broadly
 MR
 CONWAY: That's absolutely right
 The reading -- my friend's reading of section  would 
render section (b) -- I mean the reading of section 
(b) would render section  superfluous
 And there are other provisions of -- that are in the Exchange Act 
where Congress has made clear statements to show that it 
can make clear statements
 Section A which immediately follows section , is the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act
 So Congress -- if Congress -- if there is a loophole, and that's what this Court said in Microsoft v
 AT&T; if there is some kind of loophole that presents some kind of a problem, that Congress needs to fix, 
Congress can do it
 Congress can do it with a clear statement
 In sum, Your Honors, countries -- nations of the world do things differently
 They -- they -- they have different rules of liability
 We see in the amicus briefs different rules of materiality, different rules 
of disclosure
 And some rely on -- on public enforcement more than others
 The French rely on l'action publique, as  
 they say; and some nations approach ours in their 
generosity to plaintiffs
 Australia allows opt-out class actions; so does Canada
 Canada allows opt-out class actions; it dispenses with, for example, the proof 
of reliance, it dispenses with scienter in some cases
 
Yet it -- it does all that, but it restricts liability 
JUSTICE BREYER: How does it hurt the other countries if what we would say on their reading of this 
is, Congress has said, "Look, if some terribly bad 
conduct happens in the United States; they lie through 
their teeth; and you, whoever you are in the world, who 
buys some shares and as a result you are hurt, we will 
give you a remedy
 Come to us" -- now, how does that hurt Australia? MR
 CONWAY: JUSTICE BREYER: Or France or England or any of these others? MR
 CONWAY: Exactly the same way this Court said it hurts in Empagran
 In Empagran this Court noted that -- that a reading of the rule that would allow -- a 
reading of the FTAIA that would have allowed foreign 
plaintiffs to come and sue for -- for foreign vitamins 
transaction in a foreign country would essentially allow 
plaintiffs to avoid the -- the narrower rules of the  
 liability and the narrower remedies that other nations 
provide
 And that is exactly true here, where, you know, for example, Australia does not permit 
fraud-on-the-market class actions
 it doesn't recognize the fraud-on-the-market 
presumption
 And as I said, for example, Canada restricts these actions, it has generous liability rules and 
allows opt-out class actions, but it says -- it caps 
damages at  percent of an issuer's market 
capitalization or $ million, whichever is greater
 And so that's the -- that is the problem
 It's not just substance but it's remedy
 Other nations want to do things in different ways; they should be 
allowed to
 What is going on here is essentially a --Brandeising -- experiment a global scale
 And that's a good thing
 It's a good thing because it enables countries to judge for themselves what kind of rules 
they want to have for people who buy shares on their own 
exchanges
 And to apply section (b) it cases like this would cut that experiment short
 It would amount to exactly the soft of legal imperialism that this Court 
rejected, rightly, in Empagran
 The Court should reject it here as well and it should affirm the judgment of the  
 court of appeals
 I thank you
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 Conway
 Mr
 Roberts
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D
 ROBERTS, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS MR
 ROBERTS: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents two distinct questions: First whether the fraud alleged by Petitioners violated 
Section b; and second, whether Petitioners may bring a 
private action
 In our view, the alleged fraud violated Section b, because significant conduct material to the 
fraud's success occurred in the United States
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are -- there are a lot of moving parts in that test
 You know, significant conduct, material, you require it to have a 
direct causal relationship
 Doesn't the complication of that kind of defeat the whole purpose? MR
 ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, we don't think so
 In terms of the -- of the direct cause part, which it will be -- the significant limit on private actions,  
 as this case illustrates, the district courts even 
accepting the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint 
will often be able to dismiss the suit on the pleading 
for its failure to satisfy that test
 It's not a CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's only for the private companies? MR
 ROBERTS: That's right
 And in terms of the other test, again, I don't think it's that 
complicated
 The -- the significance part of it is essentially trying to assess the amount of the conduct 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: what if significant elements of the fraud occur in four 
different countries? MR
 ROBERTS: If -- if -- the critical question is whether there's significant conduct here 
that's material to the broad success
 And the reason for that is if Section b didn't cover that kind of 
conduct, then that would risk allowing the United States 
to become a base for orchestrating securities frauds for 
export
 It would allow thing like masterminds in the United States engineering international boiler room 
schemes in which they direct agents in foreign countries 
to make fraudulent representations that victimize  
 investors
 JUSTICE BREYER: So it's not as easy to apply this, you think? Now, on your theory, I guess Schmidt is in Germany and we have our Brooklyn Bridge
 
Okay, now wait
 What happens is he calls Schmidt on the telephone, Jones, and he says I own the Brooklyn Bridge
 
Actual, right, direct? Under your test, correct? MR
 ROBERTS: Schmidt is in Germany? JUSTICE BREYER: Schmidt is in Germany
 He calls him up
 MR
 ROBERTS: The defrauder is in Germany? JUSTICE BREYER: All -- everything -- you have to assume he's going to buy the thing on the 
exchange in Germany but the fraud is in Brooklyn
 He is lying about -- he doesn't really own the Brooklyn 
Bridge
 So he calls Schmidt
 I am interested in -- he calls Schmidt
 Causation, that's what your last pages of your brief, focus on that
 He calls him and he lies to him
 Actual
 MR
 ROBERTS: I'm sorry, Your Honor, can I ask you if everybody is in Germany? JUSTICE BREYER: No
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: Go back to my Brooklyn Bridge example
 Everything is hatched in your boiler  
 room
 MR
 ROBERTS: Okay
 JUSTICE BREYER: And they communicate the lie by calling Schmidt in Berlin on the telephone, 
directly
 MR
 ROBERTS: Okay
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Schmidt is the German
 He's in Germany
 (Laughter
) MR
 ROBERTS: I'm sorry
 JUSTICE BREYER: MR
 ROBERTS: The question is, is there JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm focusing on the last pages of your brief
 Where you turn this whole thing on the directness of the causation
 MR
 ROBERTS: That's right
 And the SEC would be able to take action if there is significant 
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm accepting that for the moment
 What's bothering me, taking off from what the Chief Justice said, is the feasibility of your test
 
Your test, it seems to me on causation, would say that 
when you phone Schmidt and lie to him, he can sue
 But when you phone your parent company, knowing that they  
 will put it in the prospectus and Schmidt will read it, 
you can't sue
 And then what occurs to me is suppose you phoned a reporter, or suppose you phoned your parent 
company and you knew they would tell a reporter
 I'm focusing on the practicality of your causation test
 MR
 ROBERTS: If the conduct is directed or JUSTICE BREYER: Correct
 MR
 ROBERTS: -- then it would -- then the direct causation test would be -- would be met
 The critical question is, is the conduct in the United 
JUSTICE BREYER: You think that's the question here? You think the question is whether this really took place in Florida? I didn't think that was the question
 MR
 ROBERTS: In terms of a private plaintiff suing, in our view, the question is whether 
the United States' conduct has a close enough connection 
JUSTICE BREYER: Let's skip -- skip my question because other people may ask
 JUSTICE ALITO: If the plaintiffs in this case had clearly alleged in their complaint that nobody  
 in Australia reviewed the numbers that were sent from 
Florida to any degree, they just directly copied them, 
some low-level clerk directly copied them, would the 
direct cause test be met? MR
 ROBERTS: Yes, if the action was just ministerial over overseas, it would -- it would be met
 
Again, the critical question, in our view, under the 
direct cause test is, was there culpable conduct in the 
United States that is directly responsible for the 
plaintiff's injury? JUSTICE GINSBURG: JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you give no weight to the fact that it was on the Australian 
exchange? MR
 ROBERTS: The -- the fact that the transaction happens on the Australian exchange is not 
dispositive, because if -- if somebody in the United 
States is directly -- is -- is executing the fraud -- if 
it turned on just a transaction on the Australian 
exchange, then a domestic investor could be injured by a 
fraud that is hatched entirely here that is executed 
entirely here, and he is tricked into executing a 
transaction on an overseas exchange
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Roberts, because your time is running out, there is a basic question here
  
 You are asking us to make a distinction between what the 
SEC can sue for and what a private party can sue for
 
Congress did that with respect to aiders and abettors
 Is there any other instance in which we have made a distinction, yes, the SEC has a claim but the 
private litigant doesn't? MR
 ROBERTS: Yes, the -- the -- the private litigants are -- have numerous elements that they have 
to show that the SEC doesn't have to show: Reliance, loss, loss causation
 All of those go to the causal link between the injury and -- and the fraud
 And we think that the direct injury requirement is an 
appropriate application of those more general causation 
requirements in the context of transnational fraud
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I am frankly less concerned with your -- your test for the private cause of action, 
the direct cause test -- I -- I guess I could work with 
that -- than I am with your test for -- for the 
jurisdiction of the -- of the SEC, which is sort of a 
totality of the circumstances test
 It doesn't seem to me that's an appropriate test for a jurisdictional 
question
 You don't want to spend time litigating the totality of the circumstances
 MR
 ROBERTS: We don't think it's a -- a jurisdictional question in the sense of the subject  
 matter jurisdiction, Your Honor
 It's a -- a test about the scope of the statutory coverage
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, okay
 MR
 ROBERTS: And it's true that bright line rules -- it's true that bright line rules are easier to 
administer, but the -- there is a danger in bright line 
rules for fraud prohibitions because they can provide a 
road map for evasion of the statute
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any indication that our friends around the world are 
comfortable with your test? MR
 ROBERTS: Well, the briefs that have been filed by Australia and United Kingdom and France 
are limited to the private right of action
 They base their -- what they want to do is to limit the private 
rights
 And I think the United Kingdom brief specifically says that -- it thinks that SEC action 
could be appropriate here, and that's a reason why, if 
the Court adopts the -- a limit on the private actions, 
that it need not -- it need not be concerned about the 
possibility that -- that fraud would be launched in the 
United States or directed in the United States and it 
couldn't be addressed
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we don't have to say anything about -- about what the government can do,  
 do we? MR
 ROBERTS: No, Your Honor
 And we would certainly prefer that you decided the case solely on the 
private right of action if the alternative for a holding 
substantive prohibitions didn't apply here
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr
 Roberts, you urge deference to the SEC's interpretation in 
administrative adjudications? MR
 ROBERTS: Yes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have anything other than those two proceedings over the last  years? MR
 ROBERTS: Those are the two administrative adjudications
 The SEC's administrative adjudicatory authority is limited to people involved in 
the securities industry, and a lot of these frauds that 
happen are -- don't involve people that are registered 
broker/dealers and the like
 There are numerous Civil Actions that the SEC has brought where it has taken the 
same approach
 The SEC v
 Berger case that we cite in our brief is one of them
 I can name some others
 There is SEC v
 Wolfson, which is a case that's in the district 
court in Utah, and SEC v
 Shay in -- in the southern 
district of New York
 SEC v
 Banger in the northern district of Illinois
 Those involve international  
 boiler-room schemes of the kind I was alluding to 
before, where masterminds in the United States basically 
direct agents that they have got in countries like 
Thailand or Spain to -- to make false statements and 
engage in high-pressure selling to target investors in 
other countries
 Sometimes they induce them to engage in transactions in still other countries
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 Roberts
 Mr
 Dubbs, you have three minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A
 DUBBS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS MR
 DUBBS: Thank you, Your Honor
 Let me begin with Justice Alito's question, and I promise to 
get back to Judge Friendly and the Brooklyn Bridge
 As to -- we have alleged that in -- that effectively, ministerial activities did occur here
 The Second Circuit held, interpreting our complaint, that 
the numbers were mechanically incorporated
 That's as close to ministerial as you get
 We used, in the complaint, the were "adopted
" We said that they were asleep at the wheel
 The meaning is the same, but the -- there were no 
checkpoints
 The checkpoints are illusory
 If there was a checkpoint, the guard was asleep at the  
 checkpoint, and the MSR number went right through the 
checkpoint
 Those are the allegations, and we should be able to stick with the allegations
 Now, turning to the statute, my colleague indicated that the language with respect to foreign and 
interstate commerce and so on, based on the Aramco 
decision, was boilerplate
 That's wrong
 In this statute, those specific statutory approaches towards 
stopping fraud are in the substance of the statute
 
They are not in the jurisdictional statute
 That's important
 That's why that's different
 As to the Leasco example and Bersch example, what Leasco shows is a long chain of causation, because 
Leasco involved an American, not a foreigner, which was 
very important under Judge Friendly's typology
 And in Leasco, you have this extended line of causation 
beginning with representations in the United States 
about a friendly, tender offer
 Then there was a phone call, maybe in London, maybe in the United States, and 
then there was a command by Saul Steinberg to his 
investment bankers: Go into the London Stock Exchange and start to buy
 That extended line of causation would not pass muster under the direct cause test
 The direct cause test as this Court is using it in the RICO area  
 State law? I mean, it's -- it's commonplace for the Federal law to look to State law on issues of ownership
 
And, in fact, if there is this doctrine of equitable 
ownership on the part of the attorney, what right does 
the government have to do the setoff? MR
 YANG: Well, that might be true if we were relying on a common law offset
 But in this context, Congress has directed that all Federal 
payments, unless there is an exception -- and there is 
no exception in this case -- are to be offset before 
payment, any payment, to the debtor
 So in this case, Congress has effectively established a priority scheme 
whereby when a debtor owes a delinquent valid debt to 
the United States and the United States owes an 
offsetting obligation to that individual, Congress has 
provided that no Federal funds shall be paid to the 
individual and instead that the debt -- the government's 
debt shall be offset against the debt that the --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the client is bankrupt? What happens then? MR
 YANG: The same rule would apply
 No Federal payment would -- well -- I believe that the same 
rule would apply
 I've not carefully studied the bankruptcy provisions, and I hate to venture into a very 
complicated area to give you something definitive
 But  
 my belief is that, based on the very clear text of 
section  of Title , which was amended by the Debt 
Collection Improvement Act, that no payment shall be --
even in bankruptcy, the payment goes to the -- has 
to go to the debtor first, and then it goes to the estate 
-- that no payment shall be made from the Treasury and 
instead an administrative offset shall be undertaken to 
collect the government's debt
 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a way for the lawyer -- a lawyer sees that his client has a good case 
against the government, and thinks he can get an EAGA 
fee, so he says to the client: I'd like to represent you and I can get paid for this
 But the client says: There are a lot of debts I owe the government
 Now, is there any way they can work it out so he can get the representation? MR
 YANG: Well, sure
 There™s --JUSTICE BREYER: What? MR
 YANG: As we indicated in our brief, there's several things that can be done
 First, the attorney can determine whether there is in fact a debt 
which is eligible for offset, and that can be done by 
asking the Treasury with a valid Privacy Act waiver from 
the client
 If that is the case, the client retains the right, which Congress expressly codified in section  
 , the right to enter into a repayment agreement
 If that is done, there will be no offset, and the repayment 
agreement is largely governed by the Federal claims 
collections standards, which are codified at  C
F
R
  
to , and those -- those provisions provide in section 

, for instance, that installments shall -- should 
bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and 
the debtor's ability to pay
 And in some instances, the government agency is able to compromise that debt if the 
debtor is unable to repay it within a reasonable amount of 
time
 The agency should consider the age, health, present and potential income, as well as assets of the 
debtor, in order to determine the --JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, the lawyer and the agency and the client sit down, and the lawyer 
says: Here, I can get some money for this client and that will help everybody, but I want to be paid
 So I want you, Agency, to agree that on the repayment 
schedule if I get an EAGA fee, then I get to keep it and 
I don't have to give it to my client, who will have to 
give it to the government
 And then they can sign a piece of paper and then that's done and the lawyer gets 
to keep the money
 MR
 YANG: That -- that's correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: And has that ever happened?  
 MR
 YANG: I don't know that that's happened in this offset context
 JUSTICE BREYER: But it could now
 Now people would know about, and they could do it
 MR
 YANG: It could well happen, and in fact --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what™s -- what™s the authority for the government to enter into the agreement? MR
 YANG: The authority --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if the statute says there has to be an offset, that's it
 MR
 YANG: Well, the statute also provides, under section , for the Department of Justice and the 
Department of Treasury to establish guidelines for 
agencies
 They have done so in Parts  to -- or  to  of Title  of the Code of Federal Regulations
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But do the guidelines reflect Justice Breyer's hypothetical? MR
 YANG: Well, the statute actually reflects Justice Breyer's hypothetical, because at 
section  -- this is at page a of the government's 
brief™s appendix -- the head of the agency, prior to 
implementing an administrative offset must advise --
this is on a -- the debtor of the opportunity to make a 
written agreement with the head of the agency to repay 
 the amount of the claim
 That reflects the practice in the Federal claims collections standards of agreeing to 
repayment of such claims
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what would motivate the government to agree to give to a 
lawyer a piece of a recovery that it, the government, 
thinks it's entitled to? I mean, it's one thing to work a repayment plan
 That starts on the proposition that the individual can only each week or month or whatever 
give a certain amount of money over
 But what --MR
 YANG: Well, I think the hypothetical was premised at the beginning of the lawsuit rather than at 
the end
 If -- if the case were at the end and the government were ordered to pay EAJA fees, the offset 
would be automatic
 We would not agree at that point to split the -- the offset with -- with the attorney
 But in the beginning of the lawsuit, when the attorney is 
undertaking representation of the client, the attorney 
is able to do precisely what Congress intended, which 
was to have debtors come to the United States and 
take -- to avail themselves of the opportunity to repay 
their debts to avoid an offset
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's a fanciful answer, because EAJA requires that the 
government's position, to get fees, is substantially  
 unjustified
 And so the government lawyer is going to sit down and say, well, you know, if I take a position 
that is substantially unjustified, I will at that point 
pay the fees to you, not to the client
 MR
 YANG: Well, not at all
 The government's interest in an installment plan is not 
motivated by EAJA
 The government™s interest is --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but the attorney's interest -- I thought in the hypothetical we 
were talking about, the attorney's interest is
 He thinks the government is going to take a substantially 
unjustified position, and he wants to make sure in that 
case that he gets paid
 MR
 YANG: This is a separate question, which is whether there is really any deterrent or how 
large the deterrent effect would be having the specter 
of a fee offset
 And as we explained in our brief, this Court in Underwood explained that, because EAJA awards 
are not given to every prevailing party and are only 
given to parties where the government's position is not 
substantially justified, it is -- one cannot reliably 
determine in advance whether the government's position 
is going to be so unreasonable that you™re going to get 
an award of fees
 And that -- that suggests that any deterrent  
 effect of having the possibility of an offsetting -- an 
offset for the client's debt is small
 And that --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's going to look awful bad to a court that comes in and he's --
and the court is asked to award EAJA fees, and there is 
an agreement already in effect
 The government says, well, if we™re -- you know, if we™re liable for EAJA 
fees, this is how we are going to handle it
 MR
 YANG: I may have misspoken --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be the first piece of -- that would be the first piece of 
evidence that I would want to put in saying I should get 
EAJA fees
 The government thought they might even take a position that qualified
 MR
 YANG: Let me back up
 I may have misspoken
 What I intended to convey is that at the beginning of the case when an attorney is deciding 
whether to represent a client, the case has not been 
litigated, we don't know whether the government's 
position is going to be found to be substantially 
unjustified or not, the attorney -- if the attorney 
checks and wants to determine whether the client has 
a -- a debt owed to the government that would be subject 
to offset, the attorney can go to the government and say: 
Let's enter into a repayment plan so that my debtor gets  
 on the government's good graces and no longer is subject to 
have a tax -- a tax return, for instance, offset or any 
other payment that the government may owe to that 
debtor in the future, including EAJA
 But it's not because of the EAJA payment that you would enter into 
the agreement
 The government --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but say he goes in to the government and says, look, I™m about to sue 
you, and I™d like to sit down and negotiate a nice 
agreement about the repayment
 MR
 YANG: Well, I guess the attorney may say, I'm about to sue you, but the government certainly 
is not motivated because of the lawsuit
 The government -- whether an attorney is going to sue the 
government or not, the question is --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Government lawyers are always sympathetic to people who come in and say: 
I'm going to sue you
 (Laughter
) MR
 YANG: Well, I guess that certainly gets our attention
 But the reason that the government would enter into a repayment agreement is because that is an 
opportunity for the government to collect a debt that is 
delinquent, valid, and outstanding
 And what Congress intended to do in the Debt  
 Collection Improvement Act was not to have additional 
Federal funds be paid to debtors who have been given 
multiple warnings of the debt and are essentially, you 
know --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem with your argument is this pot of money is actually not going 
to -- it's going to the debtor, according to your 
argument, because in theory the debtor is the prevailing 
party and is entitled to get the award
 But the money is not being paid to the debtor
 It's for the benefit of the lawyer who has done the work that Congress wanted 
done
 MR
 YANG: Well, actually, either --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know what the --I don't know what the motivation would be for a lawyer 
to undertake to represent the meritorious claim when 
they have to not only do the work in the case, but now 
have to do the work for the government in getting their 
client to negotiate an agreement with the government on 
something that's completely unrelated to the claim
 MR
 YANG: I guess a --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's -- it's sort of --MR
 YANG: There™s a few answers --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- illogical
 MR
 YANG: There™s a few answers to that
  
 EAJA applies not only in the Social Security context; it 
applies in all civil actions in which -- not sounding in 
tort, in which there™s not another specific fee 
provision, brought -- brought by or against the United 
States
 Congress intended -- and this is in the statutory findings which precede EAJA in section -- I 
believe it's  of the Act; it is -- to diminish the 
financial deterrent on individuals, businesses, and 
organizations caused by the expense of providing -- of 
litigating a case
 This is --JUSTICE GINSBURG: That sounds like you're -- you have -- the client has an agreement to pay 
the lawyer or the client has paid the lawyer
 It would make sense if the client has paid the lawyer and then 
there is reimbursement under EAJA that what -- what 
you're describing would make sense in that situation
 
But in most of these situations, the client doesn't have 
the wherewithal to pay the attorney upfront, of course
 MR
 YANG: That may be true in the Social Security context, but there are many instances in 
which -- this is the -- this is the normal way that, 
you know, clients and -- and -- and their -- their 
attorneys work out fee arrangements
 Sometimes clients will pay their attorney in advance; sometimes they will  
 pay as the litigation goes forward
 And by the time you have the EAJA award the client will have paid all or 
part -- sometimes none -- but all or part of the -- of 
the fee award
 JUSTICE GINSBURGH: Is it --MR
 YANG: Congress directed -- the language is very clear: Courts shall award to the prevailing party fees and expenses --JUSTICE GINSBURG: And does that mean --MR
 YANG: -- incurred by the party
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The award goes to the prevailing party
 So, therefore, the attorney's fee is income to the client --MR
 YANG: I --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is taxable income to the client? MR
 YANG: This is -- the answer to that is complicated and, generally, yes
 The IRS is of the view that attorney fee awards to prevailing parties, whether 
it's EAJA or otherwise, are deemed to be taxable income 
to the client
 Now, the clients, of course, will have an offsetting deduction for expenses incurred by -- in --
in the course of producing or collecting income, and 
that was recognized by this Court's opinion in Banks
  
 That deduction is, of course, subject to certain limits
 
It has to be in excess of  percent of the adjusted 
gross income and subject to the alternative minimum tax, 
which wouldn't apply to Social Security claims
 But the general answer is yes, it is income when the prevailing party receives a fee
 There is an offsetting deduction
 However, there's a -- some uncertainty with whether some fee awards when the 
underlying benefit obtained is not taxable, whether 
that -- the IRS will treat such payments to -- the fee 
awards, as --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Like pain and suffering, but that's not --MR
 YANG: Yes, so, but also certain Federal benefits, including Social Security benefits, 
have a very complicated tax relationship
 Social Security benefits are taxable in part
 It depends on the size and the amount of other income
 So, the answer is actually quite complicated whether fees are taxable under EAJA in the Social 
Security context
 But the general rule is, yes, fee awards to a prevailing party are income and subject 
to --JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then, in turn, income to the attorney when -- if the client -- 
 MR
 YANG: Correct
 Just as, you know, when I'm -- you know, I am paid my salary and taxed on it, 
and then when I pay for services, the person to whom I 
pay also has income, and they are taxed as well
 This is not an unusual situation
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me the underlying assumption -- and some of the question would 
have been put to you by the court -- is that the 
government has somehow benefited because the money is 
created to offset the debt
 It really isn't
 It would -- this would be true if an attorney were suing 
a third party and creating a fund, and the government 
said, ah, there's the money
 In this case, it's just being paid from one account to the other
 The government would be better off if there were no suit 
at all
 MR
 YANG: That's correct
 If the government never had an EAJA award, it at least would 
be less of a debt that it could collect
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's just paying itself from one account to the other
 MR
 YANG: That's correct
 The government is -- ultimately zeroes out here
 The person that gets the benefit is the prevailing party, because the 
prevailing party has eliminated a debt to the United 
 States by having that offset by the EAJA award
 So the prevailing party obtains the benefit, which is precisely 
what Congress intended here
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The government zeroes out, but in the course of it, it has taken a 
legal position in court against a small business that 
was substantially unjustified
 MR
 YANG: And it has paid its EAJA award by offsetting that award against the debt that the business 
owed to the United States
 The government is -- at the end of the day, the balance sheets of the government 
have not changed
 And with -- from the perspective of --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I think the idea -- well --MR
 YANG: From the perspective of the prevailing party as well
 The prevailing party has an obligation to the attorney
 Those are the attorney's fees incurred which have not yet been paid
 The prevailing party also has an obligation to the 
government in the -- in the amount of a debt
 It has income that comes in through the -- through the fee 
award, and whether that goes to offset the debt to the 
government or offset the -- for use to pay the attorney, 
the prevailing party ultimately gets the benefit of that 
fee award
 And the government has paid the EAJA award  
 as required by statute
 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you happen to know how much the -- the Treasury typically collects in a year 
under these EAJA offsets? Does it put a dent in the Federal deficit? MR
 YANG: We don't, and the reason we don't is because each agency that -- which is the subject of 
an EAJA order submits to Treasury a payment request 
based on that order, and they check ﬁmiscellaneous 
payment
ﬂ That agency doesn't know whether that payment is offset
 Treasury receives that -- that request of payment and sees that it's a miscellaneous payment, 
checks it against a debt, and may offset
 But Treasury doesn't know that the miscellaneous payment was an EAJA 
award
 So we don't have any statistics that we can point to, to say how often this -- this occurs
 I can say that the financial management service executes one 
-- over one billion payments per year, and that offsets 
of those payments account for $
 billion
 So about two-tenths of  percent of payments from the Federal 
Government result in offsets
 I™d like to reserve the balance of my time
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
  
 Mr
 Leach
 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D
 LEACH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MR
 LEACH: Mr
 Chief Justice, may it please the Court: I™d like to discuss with you this morning four reasons why Catherine Ratliff, and not the 
government, is entitled to receive the fee for the legal 
services she performed, that Congress invited her to 
perform, to show that the government's position was 
legally erroneous and was not even substantially 
justified
 And my first point arises from your question, Justice Scalia
 You asked whether State law determines who has the priorities here in terms of 
offset, if I understood
 And the answer is that actually Federal law determines that, specifically the 
Debt Collection Improvement Act and regulations
 The Act requires mutuality of a debt between the debtor and 
the government before the government can offset
 And the regulations, which I™ll quote in just an instant, 
require that before offset can occur, the government must 
look to who has the beneficial interest in the payment
 
In other words, who is entitled to benefit from it
 Specifically,  C
F
R
 
(b), which is 
 quoted at page  of the red brief, defines, quote, 
"offset," close quote, as withholding funds to satisfy 
a debt owed by a payee
 And "payee" -- and this is critical -- is defined as the same -- in the same 
regulation, also quoted at page  of our reply brief, 
as "the person entitled" -- as the person entitled to 
the benefit of all or part of a payment
 In other words, not the legal title holder if there is a 
difference, but the person with the beneficial interest
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The prevailing party gets the benefit in the sense that she is relieved of 
the debt she owed to the government
 That's a real benefit
 MR
 LEACH: Well, Your Honor, I think that's a benefit -- true, that's a benefit, I agree; but that's 
not a benefit, I don't think, in the sense of who --
because the question is who has the beneficial interest 
in the fee payment? And when we look to that question, because that's what's at issue here, is the fee payment
 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't this argument circular? The -- the issue is who is -- to whom is this payment to be made
 And if it's to be made to the --the claimant, then it's not for the beneficial interest 
of the -- of the attorney
 MR
 LEACH: Two responses, if I could,  
 Justice Alito: First, the word "payment" gets thrown around a lot in the briefs
 It can mean two separate things
 It can mean who receives the payment first; in other words, who is the check mailed to; or it can mean 
who the check is ultimately entitled to -- who is 
entitled to benefit from it
 And the government's -- my second point is the government's reply brief at page  to  concedes 
that, but for the government's alleged right to offset, 
the attorney does indeed have the beneficial interest in 
the attorney's fee
 And the government gives three reasons, and only three reasons, why its alleged right 
to offset trumps the attorney's beneficial interest
 The first reason the government gives is the government says that the -- the constructive trust, which 
the government acknowledges exists in the -- in -- in 
favor of the attorney with respect to the fee payment, 
does not arise until the instant the fee reaches the 
client
 And that's true, but that's not the point
 The point is the attorney had the beneficial interest in the fee, which had to precede the 
moment the fee reached the client, if it's payable to 
the client in the sense of "sent to
" The beneficial interest had to precede that in order for a constructive 
trust to arise
  
 The government's second argument --JUSTICE BREYER: On the first one, imagine that the -- a trust owes some money to the government
 
Now, suppose a lawyer representing the trust recovers
 
Now, they recover on a separate debt, okay? Separate debt? One
 That money goes to the trust
 Right? MR
 LEACH: If -- I'm not --JUSTICE BREYER: The trust first owes -- the trust owes $, to the government
 The trust then independently recovers $ from the government on a 
different matter
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: The government couldn't offset that? MR
 LEACH: Of course it could
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 Of course it could
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: But the trust is not a person entitled to the benefit of the payment
 MR
 LEACH: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: The beneficiaries of the trust are entitled to the benefit of the payment
 MR
 LEACH: If I understood your hypothetical, if the trust is entitled to $, then the 
trust I think would be entitled to the benefit of the 
 payment
 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not entitled to the benefit of the $
 The trust holds money for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust
 So --MR
 LEACH: I --JUSTICE BREYER: -- it can™t -- you agree that that couldn't be? MR
 LEACH: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and once you agree that that couldn't be, I think you are in trouble on 
your first argument
 I'm not sure
 MR
 LEACH: Okay
 I don't think so, because if we are talking about payments to persons, you know, 
if a person -- if a person owes a debt of $,, 
receives $ on the debt, the person receives the 
benefit of that $
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, similarly, the -- the guy -- the client here receives the benefit of the money 
that he has just gotten from the government, including 
the attorney's fees
 It happens that he can't keep those attorney's fees, just as the trust can't keep the 
$
 He has to give the attorney's fees to the lawyer, just as the trust eventually has to give the $ to the 
beneficiary
 So I'm simply saying -- drawing a  
 parallel, which -- go on to the next issue
 MR
 LEACH: All right, Your Honor
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me -- can trusts -- can trusts recover EAJA fees? MR
 LEACH: I don't know, Your Honor
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I don't either
 I™m looking at the definition
 It doesn't say "trust
" It says a lot of other things, like corporation, 
association, unit of government
 I just don't --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I™m having trouble with this aspect, and it may -- may be that it varies from 
State to State
 But as a general matter, under State law, let's say that the employee makes a contingency fee 
arrangement with a lawyer to sue the employer and wins 
$,
 It's a one-third contingent fee
 The -- the employee already owes the employer $,
 It would seem to me under the general principle of offset that 
the employer has to only pay $,, and the attorney 
is not going to get his full fee
 MR
 LEACH: That™s --JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's just --that's just the law of offsets
 MR
 LEACH: That's true
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because again, it's the same party
 If they created money by suing some third  
 person, then that's different
 MR
 LEACH: I think that's true
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and so I -- it seems to me that what you're -- what you're asking for 
is just contrary to the standard law of offsets
 MR
 LEACH: Well, Your Honor, with what I --JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's even worse because the Federal statute says that there shall be 
this offset first as a matter of priority
 MR
 LEACH: Actually, Your Honor, the Federal statute provides for offset in accordance with 
regulations to be issued by the Treasury Department
 
And those Treasury Department regulations were what I 
quoted right at the beginning of my argument
 We have to look at who is entitled to the benefit of the 
payment, not the benefit in a generalized sense of the 
lawsuit
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in the generalized sense of -- of common law of offsets, as I've described 
to it, sure, the attorney has a beneficial interest, but 
he's not going to be able to collect it vis-à-vis the 
employer who is entitled to an offset
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 And the difference, Your Honor, is that in your hypothetical we™re talking about 
one sum of money that™s recovered in the name of the  
 claimant
 In this situation, we™re talking about a statutory fee award, which is created only based on the 
work of the attorney and which is labeled an attorney's 
fee and separate from the benefit --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how is it different? Look
 This, what I was talking about, has nothing to do 
With EAJA
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: It has to do with when the government's allowed to offset some money
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's allowed to offset some money when the money is money that it would otherwise 
give to a payee
 All right? MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: And then you've defined "payee" as a person who has some beneficial interest in 
that money
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: And I think that the client here has no more and no less beneficial interest whether 
he's a person or whether he's a trust
 That was my point
 MR
 LEACH: I understand, Your Honor
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
  
 MR
 LEACH: And my point about the statute is simply that the statute is subject to the regulation 
which looks to who's entitled to benefit
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, let's take the regulation: "A person who is entitled to the benefit of all or part of the payment
" Ultimately, isn't it the plaintiff who has recovered that is entitled to the 
benefit, because this money is given to him in order 
that he can meet a financial obligation that he owes to 
the lawyer? I mean, if this didn't exist, he'd owe the lawyer and have to pony it up out of his own pocket, no? MR
 LEACH: Not so, Your Honor, in Social Security cases, which this is, and in Veterans cases, 
which together account for more than  percent of all 
EAJA awards
 In Social Security cases,  U
S
C
 (b)(), set out in our appendix, makes it a Federal 
crime for any lawyer to charge, receive, demand, or 
collect a fee payment directly from a client, other than 
under past -- the  U
S
C
  past-due benefits,  
percent, or EAJA
 And this is a critical difference
 In the non-EAJA, in the non-Social Security, non-Veterans 
contexts, you know, about  percent of cases, you've got 
-- conceivably, you've got, often, clients paying lawyers 
 on a traditional pay-as-you-go basis
 But in a Social Security case or a Veterans case --JUSTICE SCALIA: And in those cases, you agree the offset can be made? MR
 LEACH: Absolutely
 Absolutely
 The difference here in all these Social Security and Veterans cases is that the attorney is 
barred by law from receiving money on a 
pay-as-you-go basis
 So the attorney has never been paid
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In exchange for getting  percent of the recovery? MR
 LEACH: No
 Actually, Your Honor, in exchange for showing in Federal court, if I understand 
your question
 I hope I do
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: My understanding is that the ordinary payment to the lawyer for Social Security 
benefits gained for the client is  percent of the 
recovery to the client paid directly to the lawyer
 MR
 LEACH: That's true
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that, just as a background in this case, did Ms
 Ratliff get that 
 percent? MR
 LEACH: No, Your Honor
 There was no  percent fee here
  
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that was because it was too small to be bothered with? What was the reason? MR
 LEACH: She did not apply for a  percent fee
 It would have been quite small, had she received it
 It would have been much smaller than the EAJA fee
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And she could keep only one from the --MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: She could keep only the larger of the two
 MR
 LEACH: Had she received the EAJA fee, she could have kept it
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the difficulties with your position is that Congress did exempt a number 
of Federal payments from the offset, but it didn't 
exempt Equal Access to Justice fees
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 And the -- there are two points there, Your Honor
 I mean, EAJA fees -- I'm not claiming all EAJA fees are exempt
 As I just said --spoke with you, Justice Scalia, if the -- in a non-Social 
Security, non-Veterans case where the client has paid 
the attorney and then an EAJA fee comes down, that™s 
clearly subject to offset
 You have to look to that regulation and who is entitled to the benefit of the fee 
 payment
 And the reason that the Debt Collection Improvement Act doesn't address this in  is that in 
, the government had never taken the position that 
attorney fees were subject to offset in Social Security 
or Veterans cases
 And in fact, in , there were three court of appeals decisions on the question of 
whether a creditor could offset a statutory fee award: 
Plant -- these are all of our briefs -- Plant, Fourth 
Circuit, ; Duncan -- I'm sorry, Plant is Fifth 
Circuit, ; Duncan, Fourth Circuit, ; Curtis, 
Eighth Circuit, 
 All those cases said that the creditor may not offset a statutory fee award against the creditor's 
debt because the fee is for the attorney
 That™s why Congress couldn't have conceivably thought to address it 
in 
 And some of the questions take me toward the point that you asked about before, Justice Roberts --
Chief Justice Roberts
 And you suggested, or you said, that EAJA says: Pay to the prevailing party
 If I heard you correctly
 In fact, Your Honor, the language of the statute is, quote, "award to the prevailing party


 
fees and other expenses


incurred by that party
" And the two parts that we haven't really  
 addressed yet are that what is awarded is attorney's 
fees
 And this "incurred by" language -- with respect to that attorney's fee language, "attorney's fees" has a 
traditional meaning
 It's a meaning this Court has recognized in all those cases bullet-pointed at pages  
to  of our briefs
 It's a fee earned by and paid to an attorney
 And in Gisbrecht v
 Barnhart in , this Court specifically described the real parties in 
interest in attorney's fees litigation as the attorneys, 
recognizing the reality that attorney fees go to 
attorneys
 In addition, the language "incurred by that party" -- what does it mean here? Well, outside of EAJA, it could mean -- it does mean, I think -- money the 
client takes out and pays to the attorney
 We know in Social Security cases and Veterans cases it can't mean 
that, because that's illegal
 That's a Federal crime if the attorney does it
 So what does it mean? Well, the government concedes at page  of its reply brief that that language 
"incurred by" a prevailing party is supported by the 
client's implied or express obligation to pay the 
attorney the fee received
 So this is where the government's argument is circular, I think, 
Justice Alito, in the sense that that "incurred by"  
 language only is satisfied and an EAJA award only may be 
made where the client has the express or implied 
obligation to pay the attorney
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you say that in Social Security the attorney is forbidden to accept 
pay-as-you-go? Is --MR
 LEACH: Yes, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that doesn't mean that there is not either an express or an implied contract 
between the attorney and the Social Security recipient
 MR
 LEACH: I agree
 That's what I was trying to say
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but if there is that implied contract, then it is an obligation of the 
recipient
 MR
 LEACH: Yes, that's what I was trying to say, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't see how that leads you where you want to go
 Then the payment given to the recipient does indeed benefit the recipient by --
by paying off an obligation that the Social Security 
recipient has
 MR
 LEACH: Yes, but that obligation exists only to the extent of the EAJA fee
 It's not a separate obligation
 The attorney can't turn around and go  
 against the client
 I mean, (b)() prohibits the attorney going against the client for any fee other than 
the (b) fee, which is separate, if there is a (b) 
fee, or the EAJA fee
 And when --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it --MR
 LEACH: We have been talking -- I'm sorry
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so I'm clarifying, is it your position -- and this is something I want to 
ask the government as well -- that once the EAJA fee is 
awarded, the attorney couldn't sue the client later even 
in an offset situation for repayment, because by statute 
you view them as blocked from --MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- from seeking anything other than the EAJA fee or the  fee? MR
 LEACH: Yes, that's what (b)() says, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that once the offset happens, the attorney, under -- even if the client had 
other money, the attorney would be blocked from going 
after it? MR
 LEACH: Yes, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because by the terms of the statute they can only seek the EAJA fee?  
 MR
 LEACH: They can only seek what? JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Either the EAJA fee or the  fee
 MR
 LEACH: Yes, and we have been talking as if EAJA fees and (b) fees are sort of contemporaneous 
in every case
 In fact, the data cited at page  of the red brief is that  percent of Federal court Social 
Security cases result in a remand
 Only  percent result in an award of benefits
 So there are going to be far more EAJA fees in Federal court than there ever are (b) fees
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you calculate the fee under either the Social Security Act or EAJA, depending 
on the case? Do you ever calculate it under both so that you get some under each? MR
 LEACH: Yes, Your Honor
 And that's --JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- you calculate it under both so you get some under each? MR
 LEACH: No, section  says how this works, of the -- of EAJA 
 It says if there are two fees, the attorney keeps the larger fee --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right
 MR
 LEACH: -- and sends the smaller to the client and vice versa
 And that™s the situation, for example, where you could have an offset of an EAJA fee in a 
 Social Security case
 Let's say there is a (b) fee that's $,
 Let's say there is an EAJA fee that is $,
 Under section , that -- the attorney doesn't keep that $,
 That $, winds up in the client's pocket
 The government can offset that
 That's --that's what integrates all this discussion we™ve been 
having about EAJA fees not being exempt
 We have to look to the beneficial interest
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In what percent of the Social Security cases where the claimant prevails is 
there an EAJA fee? MR
 LEACH: Forty-six percent
 No, that's not right
 It's about  percent
 And I get that from combining two numbers
 There are , EAJA awards per year
 That's red brief page 
 And there are about , Social Security civil cases per year
 That's green brief page 
 Fifty-four -- , divided by , is  percent
 And this bring me to the point the government was making in suggesting that an attorney at 
the beginning of a case could never know whether or 
not there -- there is going to be an EAJA fee, because, 
you know, you can't know at the beginning, they argue, 
what position the government will take, whether or not 
the government's position is substantially justified or  
 not
 Well -- and the government cites Pierce/Underwood from  from this Court, in which 
this Court said exactly that -- Pierce v
 Underwood
 Pierce v
 Underwood is outside the Social Security context, outside the Veterans context, so 
Pierce v
 Underwood is in this less than  percent 
category of cases under EAJA which are not Social 
Security or Veterans
 In a Social Security case or a Veterans case, the attorney has the record before proceeding into 
court, before deciding whether to proceed into court
 
And the attorney can look at that record, read it, and 
have a pretty good idea of whether or not the government 
position might be substantially justified or not
 I don't ask you to take my word for any of this
 Let me tell you what the data shows
 The data, Justice Ginsburg -- this is where the  percent of Federal Social Security cases result 
in an EAJA award
 If it's  percent, that's quite a high number of cases in which the government's position 
is found substantially -- not substantially justified as 
well as legally erroneous
 In Veterans cases, it's even worse
 The Court of Veterans Appeal Web site -- this the number of  
 cases -- all together -- number of dispositions per year 
and the number of EAJA awards
 And for  and , if you add up the numbers, out of all the Veterans 
disability cases filed,  percent, -, result in an 
EAJA award
 So there™s quite a large number of cases in which -- in -- in a Veterans context or Social 
Security context where the government's position is 
found not to be --JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand your earlier point
 MR
 LEACH: I'm sorry
 JUSTICE BREYER: Imagine that if Joe Smith is in a lot of financial trouble
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: His house is being foreclosed on --MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- all his bank accounts are attached
 Then he gets some money from the government and -- including an EAJA fee
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's $, of money and , for the fee
 They put it in his bank account
 It was attached, good-bye, nobody sees the money, because 
it's whoever attached it got the money
 Is that  
 possible? MR
 LEACH: Are we talking about the government? JUSTICE BREYER: I'm making this up
 I'm not talking about the government
 I'm saying the government paid him , plus , in an EAJA fee, and 
the bank got all the money because it had attached his 
bank account
 Is that possible? MR
 LEACH: Is this in a Social Security --JUSTICE BREYER: I'm making it up
 No
 It has nothing to do with -- I'm just making up --MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- a hypothetical
 MR
 LEACH: Yes, it is
 Sorry
 JUSTICE BREYER: All right? MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: You follow that
 Those are the facts
 MR
 LEACH: I think so
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 So a year later, Joe Smith is doing much better
 Couldn't the attorney now sue him for the $,, say I™d like it? It went to the bank because they had attached the bank account
 MR
 LEACH: Outside the Social Security context, yes, I think so
  
 JUSTICE BREYER: All right
 Now, suppose it happened to be that that ,,  for the one and  for 
the other, came from Social Security
 Then how does that make a difference? MR
 LEACH: The bank could not take it because of the anti-assignment provision --JUSTICE BREYER: It couldn't take ,? MR
 LEACH: Couldn't take any of it under --JUSTICE BREYER: Couldn't take any of it
 Because of? MR
 LEACH: --  U
S
C
 
 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that in here? MR
 LEACH: Yes,  U
S
C
  -- it's cited, if it™s not quoted -- prohibits assignment of Social 
Security benefits
 But, Justice Breyer, if I --JUSTICE BREYER: And the EAJA fee counts as a Social Security benefit? MR
 LEACH: Oh, I'm sorry
 I thought we were outside the Social Security context
 JUSTICE BREYER: I changed it and said, now, how does it matter if it™s Social Security? (Laughter
) MR
 LEACH: If it's an EAJA fee in a Social Security context, the bank cannot take that because of 
the Federal -- well, because the attorney -- the 
 government admits the constructive trust exists in favor of the attorney with respect to those funds
 JUSTICE BREYER: If you win this case? MR
 LEACH: No
 The government says -- has said that in its reply brief
 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words -- in other words, no one can attach? No one can -- no one get the EAJA fee by attaching the bank account of the client? MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 MR
 LEACH: And I wanted to get back to the point you asked, Justice Breyer --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, skip my points
 They™re too complicated
 (Laughter
) MR
 LEACH: Well -- but during -- during Mr
 Yang's argument, you asked about this -- this 
repayment agreement
 The concept of a repayment agreement being any use to a lawyer who is thinking 
about taking one of these cases is fanciful for two 
reasons: Number one, SSI benefits by statute are limited to, quote, "aged, blind, and disabled people who 
have little or no money
" So, I don't know where the disabled or blind or aged person is going to get the money to enter into  
 any repayment agreement
 But the second reason it's fanciful is that the attorney only has  days from final agency action 
to file the case in Federal court
 And, so, there is  days to, you know, meet with the client and try to 
get an answer out of the government
 I've never tried to do this -- I don't know anyone who has -- but I don't 
think you™re going to get much of an answer at  days 
asking the government to do this so the attorney can 
then recover a fee
 Finally, there™s -- there™s a critical point here that I need to get to, which is that I think 
Congress has told us exactly what this language means
 
Here's why
 In , Congress enacts EAJA and uses this section  language which talks about who gets the fee, 
large or smaller fee
 Okay
 In , Congress extends EAJA to Veterans claims
 And when it does that, in  U
S
C
 , Congress uses the same language, down to the exact commas in the same place, that it has done in 

 During this entire period -- and here's why that's important -- during that entire period from  
to , and indeed continuing many years after that, 
but for purposes here, , the administration is every  
 time paying the attorney™s fee to the attorney under 
EAJA
 And so when Congress in  uses the same language for Veterans EAJA claims that it used for 
Social Security EAJA claims  years earlier, 
Congress, as a matter of law, is incorporating the 
settled administrative construction --JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the -- I thought the government said they only did that when --
when the court directed that it be paid to the attorney
 MR
 LEACH: Mr
 Yang was talking about from  on
 From  -- from  to , every EAJA fee went to the attorney
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because there was no offset in the picture because the government wasn't 
offsetting
 MR
 LEACH: Two responses, Your Honor: The offset came into the picture in , but the government 
says it wasn't practical to 
 Even if you grant them that point, the agency had to make -- totally apart from 
offset, the agency had to decide who these fees should 
be paid to under section  -- I mean under EAJA
 The government had to say, who does this statute say fees should be paid to? Now, had the government said, well, fees go to the client, says, you 
know, award to the prevailing party, fees and other  
 expenses, we are going to pay attorney's fees to 
clients, which had never happened
 But had the government said that -- that's not what they said
 They look at the statute
 They look at the fact that the attorney earned the fees, and they say we 
are going to pay these fees to the attorney
 So that's what™s going on at the time Congress in  copies its 
 language --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Congress has provided in some statutes, the Social Security Act itself, , 
that you quoted, for the fee to be paid directly to the 
attorney
 Here it used different language; it said pay the prevailing party
 MR
 LEACH: Just two points, Justice Ginsburg: Number one, we get back to this question about does payment mean who receives the check 
or who is entitled to benefit from it? Number two, EAJA doesn't say pay to the party
 EAJA doesn't use the phrase ﬁpaymentﬂ;  says payment to the attorney
 EAJA doesn't say that, "payment," at all
 The only place you find "pay" in EAJA is where it says the government 
cannot be required to pay a filing fee
 There is this, shall award to a prevailing party fees and other expenses, and (d)()(A) defines 
ﬁfeesﬂ to include quote, "attorney fees," close quote
  
 I'm finishing my sentence, Your Honor
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead
 MR
 LEACH: Thank you
 And -- and so ﬁpaymentﬂ isn't even in EAJA
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 MR
 LEACH: Thank you very much, Your Honor
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr
 Yang, you have  minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR
 YANG: I believe I heard counsel concede that EAJA fees outside of the Social Security context 
are payable to the prevailing party and therefore 
subject to offset
 That's true
 EAJA does not draw a distinction between Social Security fees and other types 
of fees
 Section  uses the same language, court shall award to the prevailing party fees and other 
expenses
 I believe that disposes of this case
 Second, counsel relies on a definition of ﬁrepresentative payeeﬂ in the offset regulations
 That's addressed at reply -- our reply, page , footnote 
 A representative payee -- as the Federal Register provisions 
that relate to this make clear, it refers to things like 
attorneys, it refers to things like parents, where the 
beneficial interest is not that of the attorney or the 
 parent but the client and the child
 It would be entirely unworkable if any time that a payee owes some debt that a third party might 
claim an interest to, that the government would have to 
find out the payee's finances and obligations in order 
to execute an offset
 It's simply not the way the offset program was designed, and it's not reflected in 
the regulation
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, is your adversary correct that under (b) --MR
 YANG: ()
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- (b)(), that if these attorneys -- if any attorney attempts to collect from 
a Social Security or Veterans client any fees outside 
of those granted --MR
 YANG: No
 Section (b) of the EAJA, which is reproduced on a of our appendix, states that 
section (b)(), the provision you were talking about, 
shall not apply with respect to any such award, meaning 
any award under EAJA, so long as where the attorney 
receives fees, the smaller fee is returned
 So --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you -- do you dispute your friend's statement that  percent of 
the time in Social Security cases the government's 
position is unjustified, and  percent of the time in  
 Veterans cases? MR
 YANG: Well, I think that reflects the stakes often, Your Honor
 Oftentimes the government does not contest, for instance, a $, EAJA award 
and because it's the government, it has to --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So whenever it really makes a difference --MR
 YANG: No --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: --  percent of the time the government's position is substantially unjustified? MR
 YANG: In cases -- in the VA context, the number is not quite that large, but there™s a substantial 
number of cases at the court of appeals --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What number would you accept? MR
 YANG: It was, I believe, in the order of either  or maybe slightly more than  percent
 It might be 
 But the number is substantial that you get a reversal, and in almost all of those cases, EAJA --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's really startling, isn't it? In litigating with veterans, the government more often than not takes a position that is 
substantially unjustified? MR
 YANG: It is an unfortunate number, Your Honor
 And it is -- it's accurate
  
Official that last hired is laid off, on the ground that if 
Chicago had done what it was supposed to do, this person 
would have had the job long ago and would be higher up 
on the seniority list? MR
 PAYTON: Let me give you two responses to that
 The first answer is that the statute of limitations is  days after every use, and it's no 
longer
 So for whatever it is, if you violate Title VII, the statute of limitations is  days
 If there is a use that goes into the future, it's  days 
after the last use
 Right now, Chicago has stopped using that
 The doors are closed
 No one else can challenge this
 To your specific question about how would it work if there was a layoff arrangement, the proposed --
the remedy order in this case -- it's not in effect 
because we are where we are -- but the remedy order in 
this case includes shutting down the use of this, but it 
also has provisions for seniority to in fact address, I 
believe, exactly the circumstances you just described, 
Justice Ginsburg
 So I believe that is contemplated and handled in the remedial order
 The issue about the policy here, though, is that if you don't say that a use, in fact, can be  
Official challenged, a use of something unlawful can be 
challenged, what you could end up with here is that 
Chicago would then take the message that it's okay once 
they are past the first  days, and they could just go 
on using the discriminatory cutoff score over and over 
and over again, and that is inconsistent with the 
overall policy of what Title VII is trying to root out 
of our economy and in our workplace
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr
 Payton, can I ask this general question? Am I correct that each firefighter in the qualified group who did not make the well-qualified 
has a cause of action as though he had been refused 
employment when anyone else is hired? There were  people hired, as I understand
 Did each one of those hirings give everybody else in the class a cause of 
action? MR
 PAYTON: The group of the black qualified applicants that are in the qualified category, 
but the qualified category is qualified as the other 
category -- every time the city made decisions about 
filling jobs in the fire department, it excluded every 
single one of those applicants, even though they were 
qualified
 So every single one was excluded
 So they all have a cause of action because they were excluded and that clearly fits very easily  
Official within how --JUSTICE STEVENS: But surely they couldn't all recover, because there was only one job available
 MR
 PAYTON: No
 That's correct
 That's about what the remedy would be
 So the remedy and -- you know, obviously wouldn't be to give all of them jobs
 That's not the remedy, and that wasn™t the remedy that's 
sought -- was sought here
 But they were all excluded from consideration, and that's a violation of Title VII's 
disparate impact prohibition
 So they all have a cause of action
 The way the remedy would work --JUSTICE STEVENS: What is -- what is the remedy other than saying change your practice? What is -- say one person sues and asks for damages, what 
would the remedy be for a single applicant who was not 
hired at the time somebody else was hired? MR
 PAYTON: It may be very little
 So if it's a single applicant who sues and not a class -- this 
is a class
 So if a single applicant sues, the remedy would be to stop using the unlawful cutoff score, okay, 
and then to figure out what would have happened if that 
unlawful cutoff score hadn't have occurred, and that 
would have created a very miniscule chance of ever 
becoming a firefighter and perhaps turning that into  
Official some sort of damage award, but it would be miniscule
 In the actual event, the award includes some actual jobs being allocated to the , members of the 
class -- it was  -- to be decided upon in some random 
way that they would be hired
 But that's how it would work
 But they are all clearly injured when they are all excluded from consideration in all  rounds, in 
violation of Title VII
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that -- each --each qualified firefighter who did not get a job because 
the well-qualified one did has a new cause of action, I 
guess, every time somebody is hired from the -- the 
well-qualified pool? MR
 PAYTON: Every time --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, somebody is hired, that constitutes discrimination 
against the qualified black firefighter who was not 
hired, and then another -- then somebody else is 
hired -- each time it's a new cause of action? MR
 PAYTON: They had  rounds of hiring --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes
 MR
 PAYTON: -- that are relevant to this case
 There are other rounds afterwards
 They exhaust the first category
 But in the  rounds of hiring, when in every one of those rounds the unlawful cutoff score is used, that is  
Official action upon the results
 That is a limitation
 You know, that is the use of something that causes an adverse impact 
on the basis of race -- and, yes --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, so they would have a new cause of action, sure
 MR
 PAYTON: That™s a cause of action
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, but they -- but if  days go from the first round of hiring, they 
don't -- they cannot sort of piggyback that onto a later 
cause of action
 MR
 PAYTON: Yes, if they sue -- in this case, the EEOC charge was filed after the second round 
of hiring, and in this case then, therefore, no remedy 
can take account of the first round of hiring
 If they had sued only on the seventh round of hiring, no remedy 
could take account of those forgone opportunities
 So, that would also play out in how the remedial order would 
work
 And I think I want to reserve the rest of my time
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Katyal
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K
 KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS  
Official MR
 KATYAL: Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the questions I think reveal, I think the bottom line question in this case is whether or not 
under the text of Title VII there was a present 
violation in each of the  rounds of hiring when the 
City of Chicago relied on its concededly discriminatory 
test to exclude the plaintiffs from consideration
 And we think that Title VII has three mutually reinforcing 
provisions in it, each of which point to the same 
conclusion
 A violation of Title VII occurred in this case when Chicago, in each of those  rounds, used its 
hiring practice with -- and caused a disparate impact, 
thereby limiting the employment opportunities of certain 
applicants
 Chicago gave an ability test and relied on that ability test in a way that Title VII forbids
 It took action upon the results of that discriminatory test 
in a way that arbitrarily excluded qualified applicants 
from being hired
 Justice Alito, I think -- in response to your question, I think our position follows entirely from the 
text of the statute
 We™re not as concerned about the policy consequences, though we do think that if the 
Court were concerned about the policy consequences, we 
Official think that there™s a good reason why Congress 
distinguished between disparate treatment and disparate 
impact litigation
 But it's the language of Title VII itself, and in particular (h), which forbids action 
upon the results
 JUSTICE ALITO: Why would Congress have wanted to allow a question like this to be left open for 
such an extended period of time? Why would it not have wanted everybody who is potentially affected by it to 
understand where things stand at a much earlier point, 
at some reasonable period of time after all of the 
information is in the -- in the possession of a 
potential plaintiff to determine whether there has been 
a disparate impact and whether that -- that person is 
going to be adversely affected by it, particularly if at 
a later point the effect of a remedial decree can be to 
upset the employment -- the employment status of other 
people who have been hired in the interim? MR
 KATYAL: I agree that there -- there might be policy arguments against it as well as for it, 
but here's the way I think we look at it -- and the 
United States is the nation's largest employer, and we 
face similar concerns
 We give certain tests
 But I think what might have been -- what was probably animating Congress was a fear that if the  
Official rule of the City of Chicago were adopted, then an 
employer who made it  days without an EEOC charge 
being filed,  days after the announcement of the test 
results, would then be able to for all time use that 
discriminatory test, and it would lock in that period, 
that test, for as long as ,  years, and Congress 
could have legitimately worried about if a test made it 
 days, an employer essentially had a get-out-of-jail-
free card to use for all time
 And I would say that that precise thing appears to have happened in this very 
case
 At Joint Appendix page , when the City announced its test results in January of , 
it said it intended to use this test for only  
years through 
 Afterwards,  came, the City, in the City's own briefs -- this is the court of appeals 
brief at page  -- they admit they made a new decision 
to continue using this test and the test results for 
subsequent hiring rounds
 That was a new decision, and indeed that's a decision, I think, many employers would 
logically make after  years, because then they 
don't have to worry about the possibility of a disparate 
impact lawsuit
 And since, as this Court said in Ricci, one of the goals of Title VII is really to encourage  
Official voluntary compliance on the part of employers, adopting 
a rule like the City of Chicago's is really antithetical 
to that, because then it will essentially lock in for 
all time that old discriminatory test
 I think another reason policy -- another policy reason Congress may have thought about is that a 
rule that forced people to file within  days might be 
damaging to the EEOC and divisive to employers, because 
it would say you only have that -day period to file, 
even before all the consequences of the -- of the -- of 
the employment decision are fully understood
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, actually in -- in this case, am I correct that -- that  years has gone by, 
but that's because of the litigation? The suit was filed, what,  months after the -day period ran? MR
 KATYAL: The first charge was filed, I believe,  days after the January th announcement of 
the test results
 And, yes, Justice Kennedy, then there was a period of discovery and litigation over business 
necessity and the like
 And in this case, the City admitted in other litigation that there was no basis for giving this  
cutoff score, that a person who scored  was just as 
likely to succeed as a firefighter as a person who 
was -- who had scored 
  
Official Justice Stevens, you had asked about the remedy in the case, and here's how we understand the way 
remedies work in disparate impact litigation: It's largely injunctive in nature
 It's mostly about preventing future problems
 There is a back pay claim that is available that is statutorily capped at  years
 Not everyone in this ,-person class could get that full amount of 
back pay obviously
 Instead, what happened here, there was a remedial phase at trial, and what they did was they 
decided that -- the experts on both sides admitted that 
 people, approximately, would have been hired out of 
that class, and that provided the appropriate amount of 
back pay
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you get --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it -- was it  named people or was it just  undifferentiated? MR
 KATYAL: I think it was  undifferentiated people, and then I think there --
and Mr
 Payton can, I think, fully explain how the 
randomization of awards was allocated
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So everybody gets  over , times whatever the number of people who 
would have been hired? MR
 KATYAL: Right
 And --
Official CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean the pay for the number of people
 MR
 KATYAL: Right
 And, Mr
 Chief Justice, to respond to your concern before, that amount of money 
is not -- you couldn't go back and look to earlier 
periods of time outside of the statute of limitations, 
outside of the -day period, rather only any 
subsequent use
 For example, in this case the remedy couldn't look to the first round of hiring because no 
lawsuit was brought within that first round of hiring
 
It was brought at the -- it was brought after the second 
round of hiring
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you had a footnote in your reply brief that said that if your 
position prevails there would need to be an adjustment 
in the relief granted by the district court --MR
 KATYAL: That is --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- wasn™t it? MR
 KAYTAL: That is correct
 And I think that the Petitioners agree with that as well
 And that's I think a further limit on the way in which this 
present violation theory operates as a matter of 
practice
 Now, this Court has said in cases such as Ledbetter that -- that there must be a present 
violation, and disparate impact litigation looks quite 
Official different than disparate treatment litigation in 
practice, because disparate impact litigation doesn't 
need that missing element that has been at issue in 
Ledbetter and Evans and Ricks, of discriminatory intent 
at that subsequent time of action
 Here, in a disparate impact case, all that need be shown by the plaintiff is adverse impact, and 
that adverse impact happens in each of those  rounds 
of hiring
 Each of the time -- each time the City used its test results and drew a line and said, you under , 
we are not looking at you, that was action upon the 
results, to use the language of (h)()
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that would be clear even though it had not been established much earlier 
that the test was invalid
 So a city could go along using a test that was an invalid test, not declared 
such;  years later, somebody comes up and says: This test that is being applied to me is an invalid test
 MR
 KATYAL: That's exactly correct, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- of what use is a statute of limitations that -- that -- that operates 
that way? MR
 KATYAL: Let me say two things: First is I think (h)() refers to "action upon the results,"  
Official and that thing happened in  years is itself action 
upon the results, and so I think as a statutory matter 
the language decides it
 Now, with respect to the policy reason, I think the reason is that otherwise Congress had to fear 
precisely what you™re saying, that an employer  
years from now would use that discriminatory test, 
because they knew they had made it past the -day 
initial phase of time, and then could use it for all 
time
 And so the statute of limitations and the concerns about repose work hand in hand with other 
concerns of Title VII, and in particular incentivizing 
employers to ensure voluntary compliance with the law of 
Title VII, and which this Court said in Griggs, the goal 
of which is to eradicate discrimination from the United 
States' labor markets
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I suppose the benefit is not that the City knows it's safe -- it can 
rely on a test and all that -- but knows that it only has 
to pay  days back
 MR
 KATYAL: That is -- that is -- that is the benefit of that particular back pay limitation, yes
 
But in a case like this, where the City knows very well, 
this test is discriminatory and, indeed, has said so in 
litigation, I think Congress wanted to incentivize and  
Official make sure there was an ability for people to sue at each time that discriminatory test was used
 If there are no further questions
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Ms
 Solomon
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNA RUTH SOLOMON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MS
 SOLOMON: Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In January , the City adopted and announced an eligibility list for hiring candidates who 
sat for the firefighters' examination
 Petitioners were told that a priority pool had been created, that based 
on their scores they were not classified in that pool, 
and that further consideration of candidates would be 
limited to those who were in the priority pool, at least 
until everyone in that pool had been called for 
processing
 The City also publicly admitted that this tiered eligibility list had adverse impact on 
African-Americans, and Petitioners were aware of this
 
But Petitioners did not file charges challenging the 
exam and the cutoff score within  days after the 
tiered eligibility list was adopted and announced
 Now they contend that charges can be filed  
Official to challenge the same exam and the same cutoff score 
every time the City hired from the priority hiring pool
 
That position cannot be squared with the statute
 
Calling other applicants from a hiring pool from which 
Petitioners had already been excluded did not limit or 
classify Petitioners in any way
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose there were no list, but each time there was a hiring round the City 
just took from the top -- from the top score down
 
There™s no list, but each time the City uses the test 
results and hires the people with the top scores
 MS
 SOLOMON: If I understand correctly, that would be the same case as this, for this reason: 
A list is used in a couple of different ways
 A list might be used to describe the strict rank ordering that 
Your Honor is describing, and in that case, once there 
is that kind of a list, it's the same as this case
 What happened in this case after that kind of a list was made, we also drew another line, which was 
the priority hiring pool
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, my -- my hypothetical was there™s no list at all
 MS
 SOLOMON: If --JUSTICE GINSBURG: They just go back to the raw scores, and each time they picked the top people
  
Official MS
 SOLOMON: So that actually -- if we™re going back to the scores but no announcement has been 
made ever that we are going to use the scores in a 
certain way, we agree that every time the city actually 
consulted the scores, there would be a new claim
 But that's because --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is -- what is the list, other than an administratively convenient way 
to use the scores? MS
 SOLOMON: The list was the device that limited and classified Petitioners in this case, and 
that's why it's so important
 Because in order to have a present cause of action, section (a)() -- under 
section (a)(), which is the disparate impact provision, 
Petitioners have to point to something in the charging 
period that actually limited and classified them
 And that was the effect of the list, and including the 
priority hiring pool
 In a case where there is no general practice, no announcement, no decision, nothing, but 
rather every time the City makes hiring, the City 
undertakes a new decision with new criteria, then it is 
making a decision at that point; it is engaging in a 
practice that is then at that time limiting and 
classifying the Petitioners
 What happened --
Official JUSTICE GINSBURG: So even though there is a clear case on the merits of disparate impact, unless the 
suit is commenced within  days of the announcement, 
then it's as though it were lawful
 That's your position
 MS
 SOLOMON: The statute, (a)(), requires an unlawful --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- is that --there's a free pass
 You don't sue within  days of the compilation of the list and the notice of the list; you sue 
 days later
 The discriminatory practice gets frozen, the status quo gets frozen forever
 That's -- that is your position, is it not? MS
 SOLOMON: That is the function of the operation of the statute of limitations, and of course 
it's not unique to Title VII
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is not exactly a title -- a statute of limitations
 It's a time you have to file your charge
 It's a charge filing
 MS
 SOLOMON: Correct
 And --JUSTICE GINSBURG: There™s also a -year statute of limitations in Title VII
 You can't get back pay, I think, for more than  years
 MS
 SOLOMON: The -day charging period under Title VII functions like a statute of limitations, 
Official and when a timely charge is not filed, no recovery can 
be had for that claim
 And the Court has said that over and over in a series of disparate treatment cases
 Now, the defining feature --JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you don't have one case, I think, certainly not from this Court, of 
disparate impact
 All the cases that you cite are disparate treatment cases
 MS
 SOLOMON: The cases are disparate treatment cases, Justice Ginsburg, but the rule should 
be the same in this case for several reasons: First, 
those cases reflect that the reason there is not 
a present violation when the consequences of a prior 
discriminatory act are felt is because the defining 
feature of the claim is absent within the charging 
period
 Now, that is a perfectly good rule, no matter whether it's discriminatory treatment or discriminatory 
impact
 And in this case, the defining feature, namely disparate impact in the sense defined by the statute, 
required by the statute, to limit or classify in a way 
that denies people employment opportunities based on 
race -- that defining feature was absent within the 
charging period
 JUSTICE BREYER: How is it absent? Because  
Official the statute says that the established -- the -- it's 
established -- namely, the unlawful employment practice 
-- it's established only if, and certainly if, the 
respondent uses --MS
 SOLOMON: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- a particular employment practice that has a disparate impact
 That refers back to (a)()
 So back in that period, on a certain date, he used that limiting practice, and, therefore, on that 
particular date, he established the unlawful employment 
practice by using a test that limited, et cetera
 MS
 SOLOMON: I -- I have two responses, Justice Breyer, and the first is that section (k), which 
is what Your Honor is quoting from, does not describe 
accrual, and it does not define the underlying violation
 
It talks about when an -- excuse me, when a violation is 
established
 And what's so interesting is that the reliance on those words "uses an employment practice" --
it™s a few words plucked out of the middle of section (k)
 You actually can't apply section (k) literally to this case and have anything that approaches 
anything that makes sense
 And that's because section (k) actually goes on after those words that get highlighted over and over, and it™s -- and it refers to  
Official the rest of what happens in a case when a claim of disparate impact is tried
 And so if you --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't we look at subsection (h) --MS
 SOLOMON: Subsection --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that says -- and it's an -- "it shall be an unlawful employment practice for 
an employer to give and" -- conjunctive -- "and act 
upon the results
" MS
 SOLOMON: Correct
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So when you hire, aren't you acting upon the results? And how are you acting upon -- you may be acting upon it, as Petitioner argues, 
when you classify, but why aren't you acting upon when 
you hire? MS
 SOLOMON: Because there is no act that limits and classifies
 And what™s interesting about section (h), it's not --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I go back to Justice Breyer's point
 Isn't it, in the very act of hiring, you are using the test results and saying --
each time you do it, you™re saying: I'm going to cut off at this limit, and I'm not going to consider someone 
outside of this limited tier
  
Official MS
 SOLOMON: Well, that's what is actually missing in this case
 The city did not go back to the test results, and it did not -- it did not create --
engage in a new decision or a new practice
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't that what "practice and policy" means? Meaning that each time, as you continue forward, you are using a particular 
practice, a particular policy? MS
 SOLOMON: Petitioners continued to be ineligible for as long as the list was used in the way 
that we said at the outset it was going to be used; 
namely, that the well-qualified pool, the priority 
hiring pool, would be called first
 The reason they continued to be ineligible is because they had been limited and classified as 
ineligible until the priority pool was hired first
 
That was the only practice that had adverse impact 
within -- as required by the statute, meaning limit and 
classify
 Now, to complete my answer to Justice Breyer --JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, Ms
 Solomon? Would your argument be the same if the practice in this case were -- required a high school 
diploma? 
Official Did you understand my question? MS
 SOLOMON: I'm sorry
 I didn't realize you had finished
 Excuse me
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose the practice were a high school diploma
 Could that -- would you make the same argument as you're making today? JUSTICE GINSBURG: And let's add to that, that it was adopted  years ago --JUSTICE STEVENS: That™s right
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and Duke Power announced to the world that it was going to use a high 
school diploma
 Indeed, it listed in the county all of the high school graduates and said: This is the list
 MS
 SOLOMON: A case like that might present different accrual problems for this reason: There might be several appropriate times when a person affected by a 
policy like that could be said actually to have been 
limited and classified in their employment 
opportunities
 And it could be when they enter grade school, but that is not an appropriate time, so if it's 
 years before the act -- so that person is -- is 
roughly  years old
 It could be when they apply to the employer
 It could be a variety of other times
 But those cases, whatever difficult accrual problems and questions they 
Official present, they are not presented here, because this was a 
closed universe
 Everybody affected by the City's eligibility list and the test and the cutoff score knew 
from the moment --JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but -- but in my example, everybody who is not a high school graduate 
would have been affected right away
 MS
 SOLOMON: But if they are not interested in employment with that employer, then they are not --
it -- you -- they are certainly affected in one sense of 
the word, but they™re perhaps -- it would not be possible 
to say their employment opportunities had been affected
 We certainly agree that there should be one time to challenge every employment practice that has an 
unlawful disparate impact, but the question in this case 
is whether there is more than one to challenge exactly 
the same thing? Petitioners --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You force people to challenge the practice when they don't even know if it's 
going to affect them
 In the hypothetical that has been discussed, somebody who didn't graduate from high 
school, you know, wants to be something other than a 
firefighter
 But that doesn't work out, and then he says, well, now I want to be a firefighter
 And they say, well, you can't, because you didn't graduate from high  
Official school
 MS
 SOLOMON: Right
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I think your position is that, well, he should have filed that 
suit earlier, no? MS
 SOLOMON: Our position is that the charging period runs from the unlawful practice
 And the Court has stressed it is important to confirm --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but what is the unlawful practice? MS
 SOLOMON: The unlawful practice here was limiting and classifying Petitioners in a way that 
deprived them of their employment opportunities
 This is what -- this -- what they were told --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we put that in concrete terms? It was the  percent cutoff, so that anybody who got below  percent on the test was never 
going to be considered until all the first people who 
got  to 
 MS
 SOLOMON: Correct
 And after that decision was made, there was nothing else that Chicago 
did that affected Petitioners in the terms required by 
the statute
 Hiring others did not adversely affect Petitioners because they were --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So could you answer  
Official Justice Stevens's hypothetical? What is the difference between those people and each person who does not have a 
high school diploma is not -- and is not hired? Does that mean that the moment that they announce the high 
school diploma requirement, that everybody who had 
already received one, whether they wanted to work at 
this job or not, had to sue, and it's only those people 
who just received the high school diploma who can sue 
 years later? MS
 SOLOMON: The statute requires that the --the complainant be limited and classified in their 
employment opportunity
 So --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what is the difference between the policy announcement that each 
time I hire, I'm not going to use a high school -- I'm 
not going to look at people who don't have a high school 
diploma, and I'm not going to look at people who don't 
have a test score above 
 What's the difference between those? MS
 SOLOMON: The difference is that once Petitioners here were classified out of the eligible 
pool for priority hiring, they were out
 They were simply out
 They were not being considered anymore at all
 We didn't go back to look at the test
 We didn't consider Petitioners
 We didn't reject them each time
  
Official There could be --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, somebody getting --someone getting a letter that you sent to people who 
were qualified didn't know that
 The only thing that I see that you sent to the people who fell into the 
qualified category was that it was unlikely, which I take 
it means less than  percent, that they would be called 
for further processing, but it was possible that they 
would be called for further processing
 You didn't tell them anything about -- you didn't tell them that you were 
going to fill all of your available positions with 
people who were classified as well qualified in that 
letter --MS
 SOLOMON: With respect --JUSTICE ALITO: -- did you? MS
 SOLOMON: With respect, Justice Alito, the letter does say that because of the large number of 
people who were classified well-qualified, a step ahead 
of where Petitioners were classified, it was not likely 
that they were going to be hired
 JUSTICE ALITO: Right
 That's right
 MS
 SOLOMON: And for that reason, that is when the injury and the impact was felt
 Whatever else later happened, whether Chicago hired a lot of people, 
Chicago hired no one, whether Chicago even hired some of  
Official the Petitioners, they had years' worth of delay
 And at this point in the litigation, it is undisputed
 The City made  hires from the first use of the list
 That's more than any other class --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to follow up on Justice Alito's question, what if it were different? 
What if the letter said, look, you didn't get, you™re 
not well qualified, but we really do expect to hire a lot 
more, so, you know, keep your fingers crossed
 There™s a good chance that you are going to be hired
 And you say those people should have sued right then? MS
 SOLOMON: Correct
 Because the impact, at a minimum, is the delay in hiring
 And the Court has made quite clear that you don't -- a complainant or 
plaintiff does not have to feel all of the consequences 
right at the outset to --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's kind of a bad policy, isn't it? You™re telling people who may probably not be injured at all -- you are saying, well, 
you still have to go into Federal court and sue
 MS
 SOLOMON: With respect, Chief Justice Roberts, they are injured
 Their hiring will be delayed, possibly substantially
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, sure
 No, I  
Official understand that, but, you know, let's say we 
think we are going to hire -- if the budget plan goes 
through, we think we™re going to hire everybody else 
by -- in  months
 And you™re saying, well, those people have to sue anyway because they are injured by 
the -month delay
 MS
 SOLOMON: They are injured by a -month delay
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes
 MS
 SOLOMON: But there may be circumstances in which information is not conveyed in a way that would 
put a reasonable person on notice that he or she had a 
claim right at the outset, and that relates also to the 
high school diploma hypothetical
 If the --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why did the City say that it was planning to give a new test in  
years and then wait more than a decade before giving a 
new test? If I received one of these qualified letters, and I also -- and I knew in addition that the City was 
going to give a test in  years, that might well 
affect my incentive about bringing a lawsuit to 
challenge this
 MS
 SOLOMON: But it wouldn't change the fact that there had been, at least a -- if you wait for 
the next list, you still have been delayed at least   
Official years in your ability to be hired as a firefighter
 And as far as the reason why we didn't follow through on the 
aspirational goal of giving another test within  years, 
the tests are very difficult and expensive to deliver, 
I think -- to develop, excuse me
 The record in this case actually makes that clear
 Despite rather significant steps, including the use of a prominent African-American industrial 
psychologist to develop this test, it had severe adverse 
impact
 The test actually compares rather favorably to the test that was given in the City of New Haven, but 
the district court invalidated it, and, you know, we did 
undertake to develop a new test
 But --JUSTICE ALITO: But you don't challenge that
 MS
 SOLOMON: -- surely the Court --JUSTICE ALITO: You don't challenge that
 You now acknowledge that the Plaintiffs were treated 
unlawfully
 MS
 SOLOMON: We have not pressed that claim
 That is correct, Justice Alito, but --JUSTICE ALITO: And were you prejudiced by the delay in the filing of the EEOC charge? MS
 SOLOMON: There was some testimony -- and we quote it in our brief -- about things that the person  
Official responsible for setting the cutoff score could not 
remember
 But a statute of limitations actually doesn't require prejudice, so we didn't undertake to try to 
prove that
 The -- repose arises naturally at the end of the charging period
 It's not something that -- that the defendant has to earn either by capitulating to the 
plaintiffs' demands or otherwise proving prejudice
 And in a case like this, it -- it wasn't possible simply to take the list down
 The Court's opinion in Ricci makes that quite clear
 Our expert told us all the way through the trial -- he testified 
at the trial --JUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't have to take the list down
 You simply could have said: Anyone who got a passing score, anyone who is qualified -- we™re not 
going to make the distinction between qualified and 
unqualified
 MS
 SOLOMON: I -- I believe --JUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't have to throw out the list
 MS
 SOLOMON: I believe --JUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't have to throw out the test
 MS
 SOLOMON: I believe the Court's opinion in Ricci addresses that as well
 That that's a -- a  
Official misuse of the test scores
 The expert was resolute even through the trial --JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the expert said -- the test devisor said he didn't make up that 
 percent cutoff
 That was Chicago that made that --that decision
 MS
 SOLOMON: He -- his reason for suggesting the  cutoff score was because of the 
adverse impact
 That was an attempt to deal with adverse impact, but his position was the test was valid 
to measure the cognitive aspects that it was attempting 
to measure, and that those related to the training 
firefighters had to undergo in the academy
 And he was clear as well, that a higher score created an inference that the person was more 
qualified to -- to perform in the way --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you've lost --you've lost on that
 MS
 SOLOMON: We have
 But the reason that I™m mentioning it is because it's not simply a matter 
of -- of why don't you take the list down
 At the time that the expert is telling us the test is valid and it 
can -- it gives rise to an inference that people closer 
to the top are better -- possess more of the cognitive 
abilities that the test was testing for, we would have  
Official at a minimum been courting disparate treatment liability 
to adjust the scores, to randomize them further, or to 
take the list down
 But to return --JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, but -- but going to , opening up the classification, is not adjusting the 
scores; it's not taking the list down; it's just saying 
anyone who passes the test can proceed to the next step
 MS
 SOLOMON: It seriously diminished the opportunities of the people who were at  and above
 
There were about , applicants at  or above, and 
there were ,  or above
 So calling in random order --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've got to -- I mean, you™ve just got to take your -- get as good 
legal advice as you can and determine is it -- are we 
going to be in more trouble if we follow the test or 
more trouble if we -- if we take it down? People have to do that all the time
 They look -- well, if I do this, I'm going to be in trouble; 
if I do this, I'm going to -- but I have got to decide 
what I should do
 MS
 SOLOMON: Correct, but read in conjunction with the -day charging period
 And I would like to follow up just briefly on answers to 
Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor
  
Official CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry
 Read in conjunction with the  -- you have got to 
finish that sentence at least, before --MS
 SOLOMON: I -- I'm sorry
 That was the -- so, yes, at the point where the employer is 
assessing the options, the City was not sued within --
excuse me, charges were not filed within  days after 
the tiered eligibility list was adopted and announced
 
Petitioners were aware that it had adverse impact
 No charges were filed then; no charges were filed after the 
first use of the list
 So at some point when the employer is weighing the options, the employer can also factor in 
the time to challenge this has passed
 What Petitioners seek here is new opportunities --  --  opportunities to challenge 
exactly the same thing that they -- that they would have 
challenged if they had filed a charge promptly
 They continue to emphasize that the eligibility pool, when 
compared with the pool of applicants, had a disparate 
impact
 But that's not a new violation
 That's not a new classification, and it doesn't limit anybody's 
opportunities in any way beyond what they were already 
limited
 That's the old violation
 That's the one they didn't charge
 
Official Now, Petitioners do claim that the shortfall evidence showed that they -- showed and the use of the 
list had disparate impact each time
 But it actually didn't, either
 That also was the old violation
 That shortfall was compiled by comparing the number of 
African-Americans who were hired using the  cutoff 
score and the number who would have been called for 
further processing if --JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you -- the problem I have with all of this -- it makes entire sense, except 
when you read subpart (k), it says ﬁan unlawful 
employment practice based on disparate impact is 
establishedﬂ if ﬁa complaining party demonstrates that a 
respondent uses a particular employment practice that 
causes a disparate impact on the basis of race
ﬂ MS
 SOLOMON: Correct
 But you have --JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what happened here
 MS
 SOLOMON: But the fact --JUSTICE SCALIA: They used --MS
 SOLOMON: Excuse me, Justice Scalia
 The statute goes on, and it describes the later things 
that happened at trial
 So in our view, read literally --JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where does it go 
Official on? To say what? MS
 SOLOMON: It goes on to say that the respondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged 
process is job-related, or subpart (ii), there is 
an alternative practice with less disparate impact
 So -- so (k), if (k) is going to be consulted at all, and 
we do not think that it should be, because section 
(e), which has always been thought of as the charging 
period, talks about an alleged unlawful practice, and 
that's what the person knows at the outset
 Section (k) talks about the burden of proof and how you go about proving these at trial, and that's 
why it uses the word "established
" But that's also why it describes the entirety of what happens at trial
 
Read literally, you can pluck a few words out of the --
out of one of these provisions and say, aha, they used 
an employment practice
 You have to read the whole thing together if you™re going to read it at all, and 
when you read the whole thing together, you come up with 
the absurd result that the charging period doesn't run 
until the district court brings the gavel down and 
determines that an unlawful practice has been 
established
 In this case, that would have meant that the people  and below could file charges within  days  
Official after the district court's decision, which is something 
like  years after the practice in this case
 And that's because that was the moment at which it was 
established
 And that's why we think that (k) does not bear on this
 And (h) --JUSTICE BREYER: Is my impression -- is there anything else in that (k)? You see, it lists about  things, let's say  -- imagine
 One of those things is that it was used
 Now, all the other things there will not have been -- are things that --
that -- to do with the test, basically
 So you have like six or seven that have to do with the test and the 
criteria, and then you have one that it was used
 MS
 SOLOMON: Right, and that's why --JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and so I thought, looking at the list, it's quite right that it's used for 
a different purpose but --MS
 SOLOMON: It's not --JUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, this (k) has to do with a different thing, but -- but -- and the 
critical element of it was that the practice be used
 MS
 SOLOMON: You -- but again, even if (k) is consulted -- and for the reasons that I just outlined 
we don't think that it should be
 It doesn't bear on accrual
 But even if (k) is consulted, it doesn't -- 
Official it doesn't say that any use of an employment practice is 
-- is a new unlawful act
 It has to be an employment practice that actually has disparate impact
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you'd have to then say that all the things that are there, the other nine 
and so forth -- all those nine things --MS
 SOLOMON: This is actually --JUSTICE BREYER: Well --MS
 SOLOMON: Excuse me, Justice Breyer
 This is actually a slightly different point
 At the outset, I indicated why section (k) does not bear on 
accrual at all; it describes what happens at trial, and 
for that reason --JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 MS
 SOLOMON: -- you really can't pluck a few words out of the middle
 JUSTICE BREYER: No, well, that's true --it does --MS
 SOLOMON: But even if one is going to consult it to determine accrual, what it says is that 
the use of an employment practice with adverse impact
 
And in this case there was only one, and that one was 
when Petitioners were limited and classified based on 
the test scores
 Nothing that happened after that, including hiring others, was an unlawful practice with  
Official disparate impact in a way that affected the Petitioners
 
They had already been rejected
 When an employer says, I will not consider you for the position, or perhaps it says, I will not 
consider you for the position until I have considered a 
lot of other people first, that is a rejection
 Nothing that happens after that, whether the person hires 
somebody else, whether the person doesn't hire somebody 
else, whether they change their mind and later hire the 
person whom they had previously rejected -- Ricks, after 
all had a grievance pending
 It was certainly possible that that would change the outcome in the case, but the 
Court, nonetheless, says you cannot wait for the 
consequences to be felt
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was a disparate treatment case
 MS
 SOLOMON: Correct, but there is no --JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the -- the argument here is disparate impact is different because there™s 
no need to show intent of disparate impact
 MS
 SOLOMON: Correct
 But the only practice in this case that had a disparate impact in the 
sense used by the statute was when the tiered 
eligibility list was made
 After that, of course there was a consequence of that
 Consequences can be felt in  
Official employment for a long time
 The people in the well-qualified pool were hired before Petitioners, they 
were paid before Petitioners, they are going to get 
their pensions before Petitioners
 Those things continue to have consequences
 But the Court has made clear that the consequences cannot be challenged by themselves unless 
there actually is a present violation
 Now, there is not even an argument in the other side's briefs, neither of them, that explains why 
there was an adverse impact based on race under (a)() 
at any point when the City used the list
 If one reads the briefs very carefully, one will see that those times 
when a claim is made in the briefs that we used an 
unlawful practice, it always goes back to the test and 
the list
 Simply keeping the list up after we announce it is not a new violation
 It is quite clear in the cases that the employer does not have to change a 
decision in order to obtain repose
 And, of course, the disparate treatment and disparate impact are simply different methods of proving 
a claim
 They are not different claims by themselves
 In this case, in addition to the statutory language, 
there are a number of policy reasons that while we don't  
Official rely on them heavily, we do rely on the statute
 They should nonetheless be considered in deciding this
 
There was no sense in which a claim filed to challenge 
the list was premature
 It was the one act that actually limited and classified Petitioners
 Everything else that happened after that either didn't affect the Petitioners at all, as in 
hiring people who had made the cut, or it affected them 
only in the colloquial sense, that the consequences of 
the prior act continued
 Chicago did not have to revisit this in order to obtain repose
 The statute makes that quite clear
 Mr
 Payton emphasizes only the policy of righting employment wrongs, but there are other policies 
in the statute
 In addition to repose, the statute makes clear that claims should be brought to the EEOC at 
the earliest opportunity
 Excuse me
 We ask that the judgment be affirmed
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Payton, you have  minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A
 PAYTON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS MR
 PAYTON: Thank you
  
 Sotomayor
 One is that there was no formula before
 There was some general guidance that was given in the 
statute
 It's much like the proposition of good faith
 Good faith is almost incapable of definition, yet every 
circuit in the United States has a laundry list of 
factors that are taken into account for good faith
 Here, reasonable and necessary expenses under the old law had a few suggestions as to what 
needed to be involved with them
 Now we have a portion of another part of the triangle, which is under (b)
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in a sense that cuts against you
 As I was -- when I was reading your opening brief, it seemed to me the tone was, well, if 
you accept the Respondent's position Congress did 
nothing at all
 Well, they did do something very important
 They had a formula for disposable income
 The question is, does that formula apply to projected? 
Can that formula be modified altered or projected for 
projected? So it's not as if Congress did nothing or it's not as if the amendment accomplishes nothing even 
under the Respondent's view
 It accomplished something very important
 MR
 HAMILTON: My answer, Justice Kennedy, is that the definition of the word, quote, "projected," 
end of quote, has -- there's never has been one in the  
 code
 That was a term that was in the  code and is carried over into the present code
 How it was applied is vastly different
 The dispute under the prior law was over whether or not the 
court could take into account changes in circumstances 
which were likely to occur post-confirmation
 And so we had cases like the Anderson v
 Satterlee case out of the 
Ninth Circuit and the Midkiff case out of the Tenth 
Circuit that disagreed as to how that ought to be 
applied
 In the Anderson v
 Satterlee case the Chapter  trustee requested that the debtor sign 
essentially a pledge that they would devote their excess 
income to the plan, and the Anderson court said: Wait a minute; there is another statute at issue here and that 
is 
  allows for the modification of the plan after the plan has been confirmed
 Prior to the confirmation of the plan, the debtor still has the 
ability -- and this ties in with some of the comments 
made by Justice Alito -- the debtor still has the 
ability to amend the plan under 
 So all of these statutes need to be read together to show what the result is
 Now the question is not whether or not changes should be taken into 
account for post-confirmation that may be likely to  
 occur, but whether or not the court may deviate from the 
statute where Congress has said this is how we want you 
to determine current monthly income, therefore 
disposable income and consequently projected disposable 
income
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you already told us that there could be a deviation through this 
(A)(ii)
 And why, if that was all that needed to be done, did the trustee recommend, did the trustee say, 
bankruptcy judge, let's move the period, let's use this 
provision and we will get another period that doesn't 
have those  months with the extraordinary income? MR
 HAMILTON: No, Justice Ginsburg, and the reason is, is that that privilege is accorded only to 
the debtor to move that -month period
 Neither the unsecured creditors nor the trustee have the ability to 
request that that -month period be moved
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it could have been suggested to the debtor: You can accomplish what you want by using this provision
 MR
 HAMILTON: The record is silent as to whether or not that occurred
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- where can you move it? I don't really -- this is the same line of inquiry as Justice Ginsburg
 What's the -- what has to be the  
 
much beyond the date of what, the hearing? MR
 HAMILTON: It would be up to confirmation, but the confirmation hearing could be 
continued as the court saw fit
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The review of the determination or the request to move the period is -- is 
what? Up to the total discretion of the -- of the judge? MR
 HAMILTON: It appears to be so under the statute, Chief Justice Roberts
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your objection to the fact that the judge has more discretion with respect 
to defining "projected disposable" -- you don't mind the 
discretion on the other side
 MR
 HAMILTON: No, Your Honor, I don't believe the discretion is not in determining the income, 
only in determining the time period
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, but the only purpose of moving the time period is to change the 
income
 MR
 HAMILTON: That's true
 And there are other options that the debtor had available in addition 
to that, that we have referred to as the four options, 
which would be the debtor could have here just delayed  
 filing the case for a couple of months and these 
problems would not have occurred
 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is another discretion that you don't seem to object to
 one way the debtor can get out of the bind that he's put 
in by the fixing of the confirmed plan is simply to move 
for a revision of the confirmed plan
 MR
 HAMILTON: Absolutely, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE SCALIA: What constrains the judge in allowing or not allowing the revision? Doesn't he have the same kind of discretion with regard to the 
revision that you're objecting to with regard to his 
establishing the payments? MR
 HAMILTON: Justice Scalia, I don't think so
  has been subject to quite a bit of litigation, but the argument that we make in our reply brief is that 
it would be simply necessary to plug in and plug out 
whatever the change in circumstance is
 So the debtor would be able to say, my wife's income is now gone, so we want to take that out 
of the formula
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's the same thing that's being argued here, that -- that you start with 
the fixed calculation based on the  months before and 
then you have to show that there were some extraordinary  
 circumstances that justify a change
 I don't see that there's any difference
 MR
 HAMILTON: There may not be, except that there is a statutory requirement as to how that is 
accomplished and that's where the (A)(ii) comes 
into play
 It's not so much that there is a problem JUSTICE SCALIA: What your case comes down to is the bankruptcy court can do this, but it has to do 
it by simply revising the plan, not by establishing the 
plan initially but by revising it
 MR
 HAMILTON: Not necessarily, Your Honor
 That certainly is one way
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe? MR
 HAMILTON: It may be, yes
 It depends on the facts of the case
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a good answer, isn't it, because your point would be the 
statute does not allow that exercise of discretion with 
respect to projected disposable income, but it does in 
the other areas
 MR
 HAMILTON: Well, again I respectfully disagree, Chief Justice Roberts
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That was a friendly question
  
 MR
 HAMILTON: I'm sorry? I'm sorry, I didn't hear
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my -- my point and what I thought your point would be is that the fact 
that there is exercise of discretion in two different 
areas is not the problem
 The problem is that in one area the discretion is specifically permitted and in the 
other area, projected disposable income, it's not
 MR
 HAMILTON: I agree
 (Laughter
 ) JUSTICE ALITO: But can the -- can the plan be modified based on -- can the plan be modified based 
on something that was known before the plan was 
confirmed? MR
 HAMILTON: That depends on which jurisdiction one would be in, Justice Alito
 The most JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if it can't, then how is this modification remedy going to work? MR
 HAMILTON: I think it should be
 For example, a good example of this would be debtor is 
expected  years from now to no longer have to repay a 
(k) loan
 And so one view would be that you ought to take that into account as of that date and figure those 
calculations, which becomes extremely unwieldy
 You are 
 guessing at that point
 The debtor may say: Well, I may be losing that, but I don't know what my actual 
circumstances are going to be  years from now
 Chapter  is a fluid process
 JUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is that the Court has to confirm a plan that is really not 
confirmable because the debtor can't possibly make the 
payments under the plan, but then can turn around 
immediately and modify the plan so that it does call for 
payments to be made
 MR
 HAMILTON: No, Your Honor
 That is not my argument
 JUSTICE ALITO: explain it, then? MR
 HAMILTON: Well, what we are saying is that this plan cannot be confirmed as it stands because 
the debtor would have to be able to make those payments 
and the debtor obviously is not capable of making those 
payments
 But it's because she chose the wrong options
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But let me just stop you there, because then the answer you gave to the Chief and 
to Justice Scalia doesn't fit
 the bankruptcy judge is not going to confirm the plan 
was she has to pay over $, a month, because she  
 could never do that
 So you are not going to get that confirmed plan which could be amended later
 MR
 HAMILTON: Well, I agreed with that
 I may have misunderstood the question that I was asked
 
But what I'm saying is that the statute needs to be 
followed and if the debtor had followed the statutes 
here then the debtor likely could have obtained a 
confirmed plan by moving that -month time frame
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what in addition to -- you brought up the  solution that she doesn't do 
what the statute tells her to do, so she's able to move 
it if the judge agrees
 And you said she has other options
 MR
 HAMILTON: Yes
 Well, the other options -- and I referred to them as the four options and the 
(A)(ii) is one of those options
 As I said, she could have delayed filing the case
 There is nothing in the schedules that would indicate that she was filing 
this bankruptcy under exigent circumstances
 There is no foreclosure, there is no repossession, there's no 
garnishment, there's no lawsuit
 So delay would have been a possible, and a debtor is always able to 
determine the date of the filing of the petition
 The second thing that she could have done is file a Chapter , and this is the anomaly between  
 Chapter  and Chapter , is that she would have 
qualified in all likelihood for a discharge under 
Chapter  because she would have met the special 
circumstances test in (b)
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then the creditors would have been a lot worse off, would they not have 
been? MR
 HAMILTON: That's very possible, but it's a formula that Congress thought to place into 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why would -- why would the trustee be urging the possibility that it 
would be okay for her to file under Chapter , in which 
case the unsecured creditors would get very little, but 
it's not okay for her to use chapter  with a plan that 
would give the unsecured creditors substantial payments? MR
 HAMILTON: Here, Justice Ginsburg, the reason is plain and simple, and that was I sought to 
enforce the rule of law in order to have the courts 
determine how the rules were supposed to be interpreted
 
By my view, it seemed like that had she followed the 
rules maybe she would have gotten there, but the way she 
did it she can't
 It's kind of like driving a car
 You can't expect that a the car is going to perform well if 
you don't turn the engine on
  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: MR
 HAMILTON: And here she didn't turn the engine on
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I come back to Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there would 
ever be the opportunity to adjust the confirmed plan? 
Because as you say, the plan here would not have been 
confirmed, but that -- that isn't the case always
 I mean, in many cases a plan would be confirmed because 
the -- the bankrupt could -- could barely make the 
payments that it requires; and then when it -- it is 
clear that, because of the extraordinary event in the 
preceding  months, the bankrupt is -- is not going to 
have that -- that amount of money, there would be the 
opportunity to adjust
 MR
 HAMILTON: Maybe not -- I'm sorry
 JUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, is your response to Justice Ginsburg "always," that it will 
always be the case that where there would be an 
adjustment under this theory, there would not have been 
a confirmation in the first place? MR
 HAMILTON: If the plan is not confirmable by an analysis of Schedules I and J, which 
are the income and expenses statutes, I am not going to 
recommend confirmation, and nor do I think any trustee 
 would
 Any events that are in the equation before the date of confirmation would likely be then subject to 
, the res judicata provisions of chapter 
 So if the plan is confirmed, say in Stephanie Lanning's case, 
with these facts known, then she would not be able to 
come in afterwards and ask for the court to modify under 
 because that's part of the confirmation order
 The other options that were available -- we discussed briefly the ability to file this as a Chapter 
 She also could have converted this case to a Chapter  post-petition with the same result, or she could have 
dismissed this case and refiled
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that -- wouldn't that amount to just a -- a waste of everybody's time, to 
dismiss it and then refile it, and then she gets a time 
period that doesn't -- why -- why not just drop out 
those  months that are not representative of her 
income? MR
 HAMILTON: Because, Justice Ginsburg, the statute does not permit that
 It's not within the formula, and that's the question: Is the formula binding or is it not binding? If it is binding then this -- obviously
 Congress intended a more rule-bound statute
 It got that
 It was obvious that it intended to reduce judicial discretion, and the statute seems to  
 accomplish that
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the thing is -- but you have explained, your number one solution for her is 
this  route, which is -- gives lots of discretion in 
the court
 MR
 HAMILTON: Only in moving the -month period, Justice Ginsburg
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes
 MR
 HAMILTON: That would be the only discretion that the statute would appear to accord to 
the court
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that, by the way, the provision that allows it to move the 
-month period? MR
 HAMILTON: It's in (A) and it provides that the term "current monthly income" means 
the average monthly income from all sources that the 
debtor receives, or in a joint case the debtor and the 
debtor's spouse receive, without regard to whether such 
income is taxable income derived during the -month 
period ending on -- and then we come to subsections (i), 
little (i) -- or (ii)
 And those are -- that's the disjuncture; it's the -month period prior or some other 
time frame, and the language is important
 JUSTICE ALITO: What do you say about cases  
 in which moving the -month period can't solve the 
problem? For example, if the debtor had good income for many years going back, but then slight -- shortly before 
the filing of the plan loses his or her job, and there 
is no prospect that the debtor is going to get another 
job? Or it could be the converse, has very low income for a long period and then right before gets a job
 So you are not going to be able to cure those problems by 
moving the -month period
 What do you do then? MR
 HAMILTON: Well, Justice Alito, I think I would tie in  with respect to the first 
proposition, and that is if the debtor's circumstances 
have markedly changed, then the debtor has the ability 
to file an amended plan; and that amended plan could ask 
the court to move that time frame forward to a 
confirmation hearing that would take into account the 
drop in income
 With respect to the second part of your proposition, and that is an increase in income, then I 
as Chapter  trustee would have the ability to object 
to it on the basis of -- of good faith under either 
(a)() or (a)(), either the plan or the filing 
of the case itself
 And those -- the filing of the (a)() was the primary way in which all of these 
disputes were resolved before the  amendments which  
 brought in subsection (b) to  which introduced the 
concept of disposable income
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you file an amended plan and have the court restart the clock, when 
(A) says only if the debtor has not filed a 
schedule of current income? If there's been a plan confirmed or a plan proposed, then the income schedule 
had to have been filed
 MR
 HAMILTON: JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't do one without the other
 MR
 HAMILTON: Those are two different propositions, Your Honor
 One is if the plan is confirmed and one if it is not confirmed
 If it is not confirmed, then you are correct; at some point the 
trustee and the court are going to want to see a 
Schedule I and J to see what the actual income and 
expenses are
 If the plan has already been confirmed, then the ability to change the plan has to be done under 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Forget about 
 I'm going to the situation where the plan has been proposed, 
let's say
 The courts -- if a schedule of income has been filed, then it's without any jurisdiction to change 
the -month lookback period, correct?  
 MR
 HAMILTON: I don't agree with the word "jurisdiction," Justice Sotomayor
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it can't under (A)
 MR
 HAMILTON: The debtor would certainly have the ability to ask the court to be excused from 
that requirement given a change in circumstances
 But again it would be the formula that would be honored, 
rather than the court substituting judicial discretion
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask -- yes, there is one more question
 MR
 HAMILTON: Okay
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask whether , which you have now invoked, does not provide the same 
kind of discretion to the court that you are objecting 
to? What -- what standards are there for granting or not granting modification of the plan? Is it pretty much up to the judge? MR
 HAMILTON: No
 I believe again the court is bound, Justice Scalia, by the (A) formula
 
It's obvious that Congress intended the formula
 It would not make much sense to read the statute to have 
some other formula
 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then -- okay
 You are between a rock and a hard place
 Either  gets you out of that formula, which is what you've said, 
it's one way out, or it isn't
 Which is it? MR
 HAMILTON: I haven't said that it gets me out of the formula
 It gets me out of the time frame issue, because certainly the statute doesn't take into 
specific account what happens if the debtor loses a job, 
say, post-petition? Obviously -- example, husband loses the job at Goodyear after the bankruptcy petition is 
filed
 And I think  is broad enough to allow an amendment which would involve only moving the time 
frame
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay
 So any -- any MR
 HAMILTON: I believe so, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- subsequent to the filing
 MR
 HAMILTON: If there are no other questions I would like to reserve the remainder of my 
time, Chief Justice Roberts
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Goldstein
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C
 GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court, I think, has the parties' arguments very well in hand
 I think the -- the one point that I can hopefully address, and it is I think 
the hardest part of our case, is to address the issue 
that Justice Alito raised, and that is, is there an 
anomaly in the fact that in BAPCPA Congress added the 
-month period, which would suggest perhaps that 
Congress was trying to lock in a particular period that 
we would look at
 And the answer to that question is no, and I want to take you to the relevant statutory provisions
 
Everything is going to be in the cert petition
 I am going to start in the petition appendix at , which is 
, which is the operative provision here
 And (b)() tells us that if the trustee or a creditor 
objects, then as of the effective date of the plan it's 
only going to be confirmed in subsection (b), which is 
the third full paragraph on page  is going to control
 The plan has to provide that all of the debtor's projected disposable income to be received in 
the applicable commitment period beginning on the date 
the first payment is due under the plan will be applied 
to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan
 
 And the thing to note first about that provision is that it, too, sets a timetable
 It's not just projected disposable income, but it's projected 
disposable income of a very particular type, to be 
received in the applicable commitment period
 So unless there is something particularly strange about the 
definition of "disposable income," Congress specified a 
period that the income is going to be measured in, and 
that's over the course of the plan; the word "projected" 
tells us to get a realistic estimation of what that 
amount of money's going to be
 Now, my friend makes the point that disposable income after BAPCPA is a defined term; the 
definition comes in the next paragraph; it's subsection 
(), (b)()
 For purposes of this subsection the term "disposable income" means current monthly income 
received by the debtor subject to some deductions and 
then the expenses
 So then we have to go to the definition of "current monthly income
" Current monthly income is in ; it's at page 
 That's where we get the -month period
 And it tells us that current monthly income is the average 
monthly income from all sources, so it's very 
encompassing, without regard to whether such income is 
taxable income derived during the -month period
 
 So, my friend's argument is that, well, Congress said  months
 The answer to that point is a couple fold
 First, as was suggested in the first half-hour, Congress was addressing a very specific 
problem there
 Before BAPCPA courts didn't know what the -- didn't agree on what the baseline was for 
determining someone's income
 Some courts would say, all right, you are a Chapter  debtor, right away I'm going to look at the 
latest month
 Some courts said  months
 We have a court in our brief that said  years
 So, we have to have a starting point to project from
 But the second point is that this term "current monthly income" isn't principally a Chapter  
term at all
 So, my friend's argument is that Congress stuck this -month period into Chapter , so it would 
be very anomalous if we could just -- in effect, he says 
we are throwing it out, we are giving the district 
judges discretion
 It's not quite right
 The place to look is in section , which is two pages later
  is a Chapter  provision
 And my friend started out by saying the problem with our 
position is that we were not following the Chapter  
means test
 That's the key
 borrowed from Chapter 
 So (b)()(A)(i) is at the 
 beginning of page  of the appendix
 And, so, we are in a Chapter  case here
 And this is the means test
 It tells us that: "In considering under paragraph ," so we are trying to 
figure out if there is a presumption of abuse under 
Chapter  -- "whether the granting of relief would be an 
abuse of the provisions of this chapter, the court shall 
presume abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly 
income, reduced by the amounts determined under clauses 
, , and " -- those are expense clauses -- "and 
multiplied by  is not less than" a certain amount
 So what happened is Congress in BAPCPA created this presumption of abuse in Chapter  and it 
then borrowed that concept, as my friend pointed out, in 
Chapter 
 So that -month period has real force and effect in the Bankruptcy Code in Chapter 
 So it's not like Congress in Chapter  fixed the -month period, 
which would give -- have a sort of a gravitational pull
 
You wouldn't want to throw that out too lightly
 Justice Sotomayor, I do agree that we ought to be pretty -- we ought to stick to it
 It indicates Congress is concerned with the -month period
 But it's not like Congress added to Chapter  this -month 
concept
 It added it to Chapter , where it's in full force and effect
  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you -- you have lost me
 MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Okay
 JUSTICE SCALIA: MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Sure
 It's back
 We have to go back two pages
 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I got -- I got it there
 MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Okay
 Sure
 I'm sorry
 Can I make one other point about that language, just to repeat it again? That the courts The term is "current monthly income
" So we are in Chapter , so four lines down"
 "The court shall presume abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly 
income" -- that's the  months, current monthly income
 
That's the -month period of income
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I -- I see
 I see
 MR
 GOLDSTEIN: See, that's mostly where it matters
 Then Congress borrowed it in Chapter 
 But it didn't get rid of, as was pointed out before, the 
term -- "projected"; it didn't get rid of the period, 
the commitment period
 But I do want to point out something very particular about this language
 Here's the phrase: 
 "Current monthly income, reduced by the amounts 
determined under clauses , , and " -- those are 
expenses -- "and multiplied by 
" That's what my friend says the phrase "projected disposable income to 
be received over the applicable commitment period" is
 Our point is that if Congress intended that mechanical formulation, it would have used the exact 
words that I have just read from you in Chapter , 
because that's mechanical
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Without the word "projected"? MR
 GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry? JUSTICE KENNEDY: Without the word "projected"? MR
 GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly
 They used "multiplied
" And Congress did that several times in BAPCPA and before BAPCPA
 When Congress wanted, look, we are going to have a mathematical formula, it used a 
mathematical formula
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you follow his suggestion and just move the -month period, because 
the statute specifically grants that authority to the 
judge? MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Sure
 Let me make a few points about that, sir
 So I'll again read the language  
 again
 So we are on 
 It says that -- little (ii) is going to be -- it's going to be " months ending on the 
date on which current income is determined by the court 
for purposes of this title if the debtor does not file 
the schedule of current income
" A couple OF points about that
 
debtor ratchet, right
 The creditor and the trustee, if the debtor a month before confirmation gets a new job or 
their expenses go down -- let's say you had a car, but 
you know that the car payments are going to be done
 
Under the trustee's view, then you still get to count 
the car payments which are totally pretend, or if you 
got a much higher paying job
 In fact, in this case she did get a higher paying job
 Towards the end of the period, she got a raise
 And we say that has to be counted, too
 We have to have a debtor and creditor-neutral provision
 In a statute that's designed to make sure the debtor pays a 
much as possible to her creditors, it's very strange to 
put this entirely in the debtor's hands
 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this
 There seems to be at least a subtle difference between your 
position and the government's position
 You say that the projected disposable income will be different from  
 the disposable income calculated during the lookback 
period when it is known or virtually certain that there 
will be differences in income or expenses
 And the government says that there is a difference when 
something is likely to occur in the future
 Where do you -- where do you get from the statute your known or virtually certain differences? MR
 GOLDSTEIN: The contrast between  and 
 What I tried to do in my brief, and I have laid it out at the beginning of the argument section
 
That's where we try to articulate our rule
 What we have done is we have looked at the cases
 As you pointed out, this is pre-BAPCPA practice
 Courts have set a pretty high bar, both in terms of the level of 
certainty and the degree of deviation
 And courts have said -- I will give you an example that will illustrate the difference perhaps
 
You have times when someone expects to get a raise
 
They don't know that they are going to get it, or they 
expect to get a promotion
 And courts will say, even if that's pretty likely, until you have actually got it we 
are not going to count it for purposes of (b); come 
back under 
 And we point out in our merits brief that in fact, it's not quite on point, but she got a settlement  
 post-confirmation here, and under  that money was 
applied
 So, Justice Scalia, there are post-confirmation events, but if you know ahead of 
time -- and this case is a perfect example, it -- we 
know she is not going to get another buyout from Payless 
Shoe Stores
 When it's known or virtually certain, we think that is sufficient -- akin to Justice Sotomayor's 
point about, you know, making it hard
 Let me make one other point
 I wanted to finish off my answer to the Chief Justice about 
 
This provision has taken on greater significance in the 
oral argument and the reply brief of the Petitioner
 I did want to point out to the Court a provision that is 
not reproduced in the parties' briefs, but if the Court 
were to go this route it would want to be aware of, and 
that's (i)
 And (i) tells us that you do have to file the forms at the beginning or you have to file them 
within  days, but upon request of the debtor made 
within  days after the date of filing the petition, 
the court may allow the debtor an additional period of 
not to exceed  days
 So it does seem to constrain the power of the bankruptcy court to shift this period all 
around
  
 So, I have made two points
 One is it's a one-way ratchet for the debtor; second, it's not 
unlimited
 The third is it just doesn't make any sense
 Why would Congress design a system that would have all 
of these machinations
 If we agree that Congress wants -- it seems my friend and I agree that Congress 
believes that she shouldn't have to make the payments 
that would be required under the trustee's reading of 
"projected disposable income
" The question is how we get there
 The trustee's answer is that you are required by the text; I'm sorry, Congress took this 
option away
 And I think that, as I have explained, the term "projected disposable income to be received in the 
applicable commitment period" really is not language 
that you would ordinarily construe to ignore changes 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think -- I think that's exactly right when you look at term 
"projected disposable income
" MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Yes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you look as MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Yes
 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- as a defined term 
different -- different argument, different kettle of 
fish
 I mean, because particularly in a statute intended to restrict discretion, it's a way to do it
 
You look at it in the abstract, "projected disposable 
income," it doesn't achieve that objective
 MR
 GOLDSTEIN: And that is exactly, Mr
 Chief Justice, why I started with the definition of 
"current monthly income in the -month period
" I agree that it is an important point
 It is their strongest argument
 My only point is that I have explained, I think, why Congress put the -month period in for 
purposes of Chapter  and also to have the starting 
point
 If I -- to give you an example, take inflation
 If we were to define inflation as the amount in the rise 
in prices over the previous  months, if Congress did 
that in a statute and then told us to look at projected 
inflation, we would still not ignore things that will 
tell us that there are going to be -- there has been an 
oil price spike or an increase in health care costs
 It would take a pretty firm, firm period that told us to 
only look into the past and not look into the future, 
particularly when the whole point of the statute is to 
 make sure that the money goes into the creditor's hands 
that the debtor is able to pay
 On the point of discretion, I should also say BAPCPA as a whole was intended to reduce discretion
 
And, so, it's kind of odd to say that the answer to our 
position is to turn to all of these other discretionary 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you -- you wanted to achieve your friend's result and you had a 
definition of disposable income, and you wanted the 
court to -- you don't want to say project that forward, 
what -- what word would be more natural than saying 
projected? MR
 GOLDSTEIN: I -- I -- I would use the language that Congress did in 
 Remember, the current monthly income reduced by the amounts determined 
under clauses , , and  and multiplied by 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's altering disposable income -- the definition of disposable 
income
 I'm asking isn't the most natural word to achieve your friend's result to use projected
 What other word would you say when you say this is the period 
you look at and you want to take it forward? MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Multiply
 And Congress did that a bunch of times
 Projected -- if we try to  
 project something, we try and make the -- and everybody 
agrees on the definition, so really, it's not an unusual 
term
 It is: You make your best estimate of the future based on the data you have now
 My friend is right
 One piece of data we have now is her previous  months' 
income
 Another piece of data is we know that she's not going to have the same income in the future
 If there are no further questions
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel
 Ms
 Harrington
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH HARRINGTON ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT MS
 HARRINGTON: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In bankruptcy, as in many areas of the law, Congress has tried to balance on the one hand, doing 
case-specific justice, and on the other hand, ensuring 
that the statutory scheme is administrable
 Now, Congress certainly could have chosen to elevate 
simplicity over accuracy by telling bankruptcy courts to 
take a debtor's current disposable income and multiply 
that number by the number of months in the plan in 
assessing whether the plan is confirmable
 But there are several strong signals in the code that that is  
 actually not what Congress intended courts to do
 JUSTICE ALITO: But do you think bankruptcy courts are supposed to be economic forecasters? For example, if you -- after calculating the debtor's income 
during the -month period, the -month lookback period, 
should the bankruptcy court said, well -- say: Well, it's -- inflation is projected to be such-and-such over 
the term of this plan, so I am just going to increase it 
by the amount of inflation; or: This person works in a particular industry where historically, over the last 
five years or ten years, there's been a  percent 
increase in salary per year, so I'm going to multiply it 
by -- multiply the disposable income figure like that? MS
 HARRINGTON: Certainly not, Justice Alito
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why not? You say that the bankruptcy courts should take into account things 
that are likely to occur in the future
 MS
 HARRINGTON: we are not saying that bankruptcy courts should ever 
speculate about what might happen in the future
 What we are saying is that bankruptcy courts should take into 
account what they know, in this case, already has 
happened, but also what they know will happen
 And so to give an example of a change that would benefit  
 creditors, if as -- as I mentioned earlier, if a debtor 
has secured a higher-paying job just before or just 
after she filed her petition, a Court should be able to 
take into account the fact that her income going forward 
would be greater than would be reflected in the 
calculation of her current disposable income
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, "know will happen" is quite different from "likely to happen," and I thought 
your test was likely to happen
 MS
 HARRINGTON: Well, likely to happen based on what you know now
 I think -- we haven't suggested a particular burden of proof
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not likely, based on what you know
 Well, that's quite different from you know it will happen
 MS
 HARRINGTON: Right
 So there is an example mentioned earlier: If the debtor is repaying a loan to her (k) program, that is the type of loan 
that can't be extended time-wise
 And so she will keep making those payments, which will be deducted as an 
expense in the calculation of her current disposable 
income, but -- but you know at a certain point, she is 
likely to stop making those payments
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a difference between your test and the Respondent's test?  
 MS
 HARRINGTON: Not according to what I heard Mr
 Goldstein say at the argument
 Again, we do JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: His words were "known to a virtual certainty," which are -- likely to happen is 
different than likely to happen
 MS
 HARRINGTON: I think, in part, it depends on what type of change you are talking about
 
Again, we would never say that a court should speculate 
about what should happen
 But, for instance, to take another example on the expense side, if a debtor when 
she proposes her plan owns a second home, a vacation 
home that is secured by a mortgage, then that secured 
debt payment is an expense that would be deducted from 
her income in the calculation of her current disposable 
income
 But if she proposes to surrender that property as a condition of her plan, she will no longer have that 
debt payment going forward
 And so that's the type of -- so it will no longer be an expense going forward
 
Under Petitioner's view, a court would not be able to 
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's "know will happen
" That is "know will happen
" But I don't know how you can, at one and the same time, say: Courts shall not speculate, and then say that the test is 
 "likely to happen
" MS
 HARRINGTON: JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, to -- you know, to look forward and say: Is it likely or not likely? That's speculation
 I don't know a better definition of speculation, to tell you the truth
 MS
 HARRINGTON: Okay
 But then, we wouldn't -- we are not trying to advance that view of 
"likely
" And again, in this case the change had already occurred, so there is no uncertainty about what 
her situation is now and what we can project it to be 
going forward
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that, 
well, depending on how broad a theory you are adopting 
of what's projected and what's not, that you are taking 
into account a lot of things that are more properly 
taken into account when it comes to whether the plan 
should be confirmed or not
 MS
 HARRINGTON: CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's going to happen? What's the situation going to be? What should, you know, the creditors get? What should the debtor get? There is no reason to kind of shoehorn those into the projected disposable income
  
 MS
 HARRINGTON: Well, except that if the creditor or a trustee objects, then the calculation of 
projected disposable income is one of the conditions of 
confirmability of the plan
 The court can't confirm it CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is that -- I mean, let's say your friend wins up to the point and 
somebody else, when it gets to confirmation, can say: 
Well, look, you know, there was this big payout before 
the filing
 So don't confirm it
 We know she has got all this -- all this other money
 That -- it could do it that way, couldn't it? MS
 HARRINGTON: I'm sorry, if she got a higher-paying job just before? Is that what you're suggesting? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, whatever the situation is, can't that be taken into account when it 
comes to confirmation? MS
 HARRINGTON: Well, it could affect the -- well, one thing that is important to note that hasn't 
been brought up is under Section (a)(), the court 
is actually -- which is the feasibility provision -- the 
Court is actually required to think about what is going 
to happen in the future, whether a debtor is going to be 
able to repay her creditors
 And so it doesn't make 
 very much sense to, on the one hand, require a court to 
consider what it knows will happen in the future in 
determining feasibility, and then on the other hand, if 
there's an objection by the creditor or the trustee and 
(b) comes into play, to prohibit a court from 
considering the same facts it knows about what is going 
JUSTICE ALITO: What if the debtor is a waiter and during the last month of the -month period, 
because of some change of the economy the waiter's tips 
have gone up either way up or way down? What's the court supposed to do then? MS
 HARRINGTON: Well, I think one purpose of having the -month lookback period in the calculation 
of current income is exactly to take into account those 
situations
 There are many people who are gainfully employed full time, but whose -- whose income fluctuates 
over time
 And so requiring that courts use the -month lookback period, I think, gives creditors a better sense 
of whether the current income figure provided by the 
debtor is accurate
 It reduces the chance for strategic filing because it sort of takes some of the significance 
away of the time of filing
 And so it seems fairer in that case to consider that -month average in a case where income  
 fluctuates up and down as an accurate sense of what the 
-- what the debtor's current income is
 And again, in many -- in a significant number of cases the calculation 
of a current disposable income will be a good prediction 
of what the debtor's disposable income will be going 
forward
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you deal with the Petitioner's -- the two arguments Petitioner makes? One is that on the expense side, Congress provided for 
special circumstances, exceptions, and it didn't on the 
income side? MS
 HARRINGTON: Well, the special circumstances exception comes in, in the calculation of 
the debtor's current disposable income, but it doesn't 
tell you what to do in terms of projecting that 
disposable income
 And so you can adjust what you think the current disposable income is based on an expense 
that isn't accounted for in the standard expenses or an 
expense that is accounted for, but is higher than is 
accounted for in those expenses
 But again, it doesn't tell you what to do -- how to project that number going 
forward
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the argument that this is a simple thing; she didn't have to file the 
plan -- she didn't have to file the petition at a time  
 when those two months would be in the -month lookback
 
She could have waited
 MS
 HARRINGTON: Well, that is certainly true of this debtor, of the Respondent in this case
 
That is not an option available to all debtors, many of 
whom are facing foreclosure proceedings or imminent 
foreclosure proceedings
 Delay is simply not an option
 And if I could address Section (A)(A)(ii) option that the Petitioner offers -- I 
mean, one thing to note is it doesn't give the Court the 
discretion to set any other -- to just pick any other 
-month lookback period
 They pick a date and go  months back from whatever that date is
 So if a change occurs very soon before the filing of the petition, it 
makes it very hard for a court to use that provision to 
change the lookback period because you would have to 
wait  months, essentially, after the filing of the 
petition to set it back
 But again, the biggest problem with using that section as a workaround is that that is an option 
that is available to debtors, but not to creditors
 If a debtor files a Chapter  petition along with all the 
Schedules that are required under Section  of the 
code, then the debtor has no option for -- excuse me, 
the creditor has no option and the trustee has no  
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the creditor has the option of objecting the confirmation of the 
plan
 MS
 HARRINGTON: They can object to confirmation of the plan, but on what -- what basis? If the Petitioner argues that the calculation of projected 
disposable income is merely a mechanical multiplication 
of the current disposable income times  or , then 
they have no way of allowing the court to take account 
of a change that has happened just before or after the 
time of the petition that would inure to the creditor's 
benefit
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They can't say: I object because the -month period is unrepresentative 
because of this particular event? MS
 HARRINGTON: They could say that, but it's not clear in the code that that is a basis for 
refusing to confirm a plan
